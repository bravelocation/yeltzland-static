# The original Yeltzland website #

Yeltzland was the first ever [Halesowen Town](http://ht-fc.com) website that I ran from around 1997-2006

Most of the site is of little interest now, but I wanted to keep the historical news stories alive, so I extracted the data into a static Jekyll site still hosted at [http://yeltzland.net](http://yeltzland.net)
