<p>The Yeltz march up the table (we're now 3rd) continues&#xD;
with a 2-1 win over Dorchester. Evran got the first just after half-time, and we we're looking in command until Dorchester got a shock equalizer in the 87th minute. However Snapper saved the day by poking in the winner in injury time. Phew!</p>
