<p>
  <p>Yeltz 7 Villa 4. Of course this is a serious tournament. Brian Little must be worried for his job after the team that's in the last 8 of the UEFA Cup is been dumped out of the B'ham Senior Cup by the mighty Yeltz.</p>
  <p>Scorers: Piearce 2, Crisp 2 (1 pen), Cooper, Reed and Yates - it was after extra time, but 7 is a pretty good total.</p>
