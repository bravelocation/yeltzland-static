title: CRISP'S GOALDEN WONDER
match: Yeltz 2 Merthyr 2
---

<p>
  <p>Some excellent finishing and quality football meant the final score was Halesowen 7 Merthyr 1 - unfortunately that was only the supporters' game in the morning. In the real thing, The Yeltz twice came from behind to draw 2-2 in a game we really needed to win.</p>
  <p>
    Two brilliant pieces of finishing by Merthyr's Ian Mitchell, separated by a brilliant move and finish by Piearce meant we went in at the break 2-1 behind.

  <p>We came out strongly in the second half and Crispy scored a (goalden) wonder of a goal, flicking it up and then volleying it in from all of 60 yards - it gets farther out the more I think about it.</p>
  <p>With just about all of the other chasers winning, we've slipped back to 6th place. We CAN still do it, but we really need to start putting a winning run together.</p>
