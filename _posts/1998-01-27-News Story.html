<p>
  <p>An excellent 2-1 away win (haven't said that much this year) against Bromsgrove, but unfortunately it was only in the Worcestershire Senior Cup. Goals from Cooper and Yates means we're through to the semi-finals already.</p>
  <p>Other results means we've slipped to 7th place in the league now. Ho hum.</p>
