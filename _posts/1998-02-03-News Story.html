<p>
  <p>Our glorious B'ham Senior Cup run continues with an exciting 2-2 draw against Tamworth.</p>
  <p>We were 1-0 down at half-time and shortly after the break had Snapper sent off, presumably for dissent after a foul. This sparked us into action, and goals from Reed and a Cripsy penalty meant we looked like going through, especially as they were also down to 10 men by now. However deep into injury time, they equalised from a retaken free-kick.</p>
