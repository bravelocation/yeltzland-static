<p>Two on the trot. After stuffing bottom-placed Ashford away on Saturday, our away form continues to improve as we beat Bath 3-1 at Twerton Park. All three goals were scored by Steve Pie-arce before they got a late consolation goal, and the three points have put us back up to 5th place in the table. I reckon if we win our last 12 league games we'll do it :-)</p>
