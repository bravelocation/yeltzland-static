<p>We reckoned we'd probably need to win every game to stand a chance. We only drew at home to Tamworth 1-1, so I think we can OFFICIALLY announce the end of our promotion hopes. After the promise of the last few games, it's a bit depressing to go back to playing so poorly. We needed a late penalty from Steve Piearce to earn the point, and didn't really deserve any more.</p>
