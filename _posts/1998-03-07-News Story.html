<p>
  <p>At one point in the second half we put 6 passes together. That was about the most memorable thing in a pretty 0-0 draw at Cambridge.</p>
  <p>I suppose they weren't that bad really, and young McDonnell made a couple of brilliant saves to keep us in it. Stewart told me that supposedly there were scouts from Ajax watching City's wonderboy Neil Harris, who's already had trials with Liverpool and Cologne, but he felt sure that Danny would have impressed them.</p>
