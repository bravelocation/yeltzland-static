<p>
  <p>It's been a long run, but we've finally made it. Goals from Evran, Sharpy and Cooper clinched a 3-2 victory after extra-time against Blues in the B'ham Senior Cup semi-final. We've now got Redditch - who we beat earlier in the season in the FA Cup - in the final, which I think will be held at The Hawthorns. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>We've also now scored 100 goals in all competitions this season (55 games so far), which is not bad at all.</p>
