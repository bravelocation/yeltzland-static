<p>
  <p>A tactical 2-0 loss to Forest Green to try and keep good friends Merthyr in the league. It might well work as they crashed 3-0 at Burton and are now back in second. Elsewhere, Bromsgrove beat Sittingbourne to boost their chances of staying up.</p>
  <p>There's also renewed talk of creating a Conference Division Two - the Telegraph reports of a meeting this week between the FA and Conference officials - but I guess this won't be appearing (if at all) until the season after next. I reckon we might go up if we have to finish in the top seven!</p>
