match: BSC FINAL  Yeltz 3 Redditch 1
---

<p>
  <p>Despite having a few doubts about whether it really matters, The Yeltz won their first trophy in <b>9 years</b> by beating a weary Redditch 3-1 in the B'ham Senior Cup Final.</p>
  <p>We took an early lead through a Snapper long-distance strike, but then Redditch equalised and generally looked the more dangerous. It was their fifth game in five days, so the longer it went, the more you felt they must tire.</p>
  <p>Sharpey poked home a second after the break, but only a couple of brilliant saves by Danny and some mad scrambles kept us ahead. Finally, Kevin scored the third after a brilliant move on the break, and the trophy was ours. We celebrated in the traditional manner, taking turns putting the lid on our head whilst drinking too much in the clubhouse.</p>
  <p>In the league, Forest Green beat Merthyr 3-1, and now only need a draw at home to Bath to go up. If they lose, Merthyr will win the title if they can go to Ashford and win. At the bottom, it's two out of Salisbury, Sittingbourne and Bromsgrove to join St. Leonards and Ashford in the bottom four.</p>

    We've got Bath at home in the league on Thursday, then it's fancy dress for the last game at Hastings ().

  <p>PS The Jolly Boys drew 2-2 in their game vs. Radio WM on Sunday, a match that was much better than the Crawley game the day before according to some observers!</p>
