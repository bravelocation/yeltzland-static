    I guess we hadn't thought through the effects of the Bosman ruling. The summer started with the shock departure ofto Hereford. He wanted Conference football, we couldn't give it to him so he left. I think it was difficult for him, and it sure was for us.

  <p>We started with our traditional opener against the Albion. After we beat them a few years ago, they usually put a decent team out now, and we lost 4-0. Next was a 2-1 win at Oldbury, then 0-0 draws in Andy Bradley's testimonial against old rivals Hednesford and against Sandwell Borough. An excellent 1-0 stuffing of Stourbridge, a 3-1 win over Stourport and a 2-0 loss against Blakenall completed the warm-up.</p>
