<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz came unstuck in the backstreets of Gresley, losing 2-0 to the champions of two seasons ago.</p>
  <p>We always seem to struggle here - the only reason I can think of is their bizarrely sloping pitch. I think it's terrible any team should be allowed to play on a ground that isn't perfectly flat - like wot ours is (now). :-)</p>
