  <p>Another disappointing result. I suppose the new players need a bit off time to gel together, but it's not been the most promising of starts.</p>
  <p>It all started so well, with Danny saving a penalty and then Pie-arce scoring to put us ahead. Burton scrambled in an equaliser before the break, then scored two more in the second half for a deserved victory.</p>
