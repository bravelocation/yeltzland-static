  <p>After all, what is there to be depressed about? We have got one point in the last four games. Clean sheets count for nothing, so who cares that we haven't had one this season?</p>
  <p>The game at Cambridge followed the usual trend of us looking reasonable without actually creating anything and then letting in a couple of pretty average goals with some pretty average defending. To be fair, the injury crisis meant that Rob Elmes had to play up front for what I can only assume was for the first time ever, and their keeper did make one good save.</p>
