<p>
  <p>Despite their ridiculously long injury list getting even longer, The Yeltz continued to improve with a 3-1 victory at home to Atherstone.</p>
  <p>It was 0-0 at half time, but a penalty converted by Crispy after a handball put Halesowen into the lead. Delton Francis scored from an acute angle soon afterwards, and Mark Peters scored a third near the end, with Atherstone scoring from the spot in injury time.</p>
