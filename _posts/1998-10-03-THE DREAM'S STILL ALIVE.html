match: FAC  Yeltz 2 Eastwood 2

<p>
  <p>We making hard work of it, but we're still in the FA Cup. Despite twice being ahead, it ended up 2-2 with the replay on Wednesday.</p>
  <p>Nothing happened in the first half, and not a lot in the second until their semi-retired keeper decided to drop the ball at Matty Gardiner's feet in front of goal. Our defence then went walkabout (again) to let them back in it, but it looked as though we'd clinched it when the best move of the game led to a Yeltz second.</p>
  <p>Super-winger Rob Elmes broke down the right, and his first time cross picked out Pie-arce for a superb winner in the 88th minute. Unfortunately, Eastwood then went down the other end and got another equaliser, a sort of swivelly over the shoulder shot that snuck in the corner.</p>
  <p>The replay's on Wednesday, and the winner will be at home to Gresley in the next round.</p>
