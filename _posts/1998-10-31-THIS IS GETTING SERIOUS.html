  <p>Four losses on the trot - things aren't looking too good at the moment.</p>
  <p>On an atrocious day, new signing Delton Francis fired The Yeltz into an early lead at Rothwell on Saturday. Our increasingly shaky defence managed to hold out until the 75th minute, but then an equaliser and a late Rothwell winner meant we went home pointless (again).</p>
