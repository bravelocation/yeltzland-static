    Colin Brookes says he doesn't want to be the new manager, but his spell as caretaker manager has started excellently. Two wins on the trot and . Unbelievable!

  <p>The latest victory was against last year's runners-up Merthyr. The Yeltz took advantage of the strong wind in the second half to score two excellent goals. Delton scored the first from a crisp Crisp cross, and Piearce clinched an excellent result with a controversial second, on the break after Merthyr were denied a penalty, poor things. :-)</p>
