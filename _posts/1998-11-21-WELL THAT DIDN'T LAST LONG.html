match: Dorchester 2 Yeltz 0

<p>
  <p>After the false dawn of a couple of wins, The Yeltz are back to their depressing ways, this time losing 2-0 at bottom of the table Dorchester.</p>
  <p>Dorchester had only previously won one game against Grantham, so this was particularly disappointing. I think the manager situation needs sorting out quickly, as the way things are going we could well be in relegation trouble before long.</p>
  <p>Also, I've received an interesting message from Simon Swallow on the  <a href="/haveyoursay/guestbook/default.asp">Yeltzland guestbook</a>  you might find interesting.</p>
