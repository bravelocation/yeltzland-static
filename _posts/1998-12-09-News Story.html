  <p>The Yeltz safely progressed through to the next round of the League Cup by beating Bromsgrove 2-1, 3-1 on aggregate.</p>
  <p>
    The game was delayed for a long time just after the kick-off when one of the Bromsgrove defenders unfortunately broke his leg. When the game was finally restarted, we flew at Bromsgrove and early goals fromandmeant the tie was just about safe. We perhaps should have scored more, but despite a late consolation for Bromsgrove we ran out easy winners.
