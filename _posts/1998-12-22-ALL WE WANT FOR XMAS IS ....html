  <p>Here's a sobering thought: For the last three years the team in the fourth relegation spot got <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=02051998"&gt;45pts</a> , <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=03051997"&gt;45pts</a> and <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=04051996"&gt;46pts</a> . After half our league games this season we've got 23pts.</p>
  <p>We're now out of another cup, <b>losing 2-0 at home to Bilston in the League Cup</b> .</p>
