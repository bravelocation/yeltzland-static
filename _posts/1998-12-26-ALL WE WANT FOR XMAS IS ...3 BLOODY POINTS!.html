  <p>Even more depressingly, <b>it was all we deserved</b> . We were two down fairly early on, but got one back when a shot by Ian Reed was deflected by in by Steve Piearce - although the goal's been officially credited to <b>Reedy</b> . We had hopes of getting back into it in the second half down the slope, but it wasn't to be as it was only a couple of brilliant saves by Danny that kept the score down.</p>
  <p>Here's a bit of <b>light-hearted</b> holiday reading for you - <b>our league record broken down in a completely arbritary way</b> :</p>
