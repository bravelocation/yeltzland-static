<p>Perhaps we've turned the corner. In a fantastic start to 1999, <b>The Yeltz beat runaway leaders Nuneaton 2-0</b> in front a bumper holiday crowd of 1521, <b>the goals coming from Paul Birch</b> -  following a brilliant in the 14th minute - and a late clincher from <b>Evran</b> in injury-time after their keeper had been sent off.</p>
