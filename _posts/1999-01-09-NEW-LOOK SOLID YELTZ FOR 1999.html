match: Crawley 1 Yeltz 1
---

<p>
  <p>The Yeltz earned a hard-fought point on Saturday with <b>an excellent 1-1 draw at high-flying Crawley</b> .</p>
  <p>They're probably the only team who can get remotely close to Nuneaton if they win their games in hand, so it was never going to be easy. <b>They had most of the play</b> , but the defence - and Danny in particular - were well solid. We even <b>took the lead</b> through a <b>Ralphy Crisp</b> header just after half-time, but they equalised just after and piled on the pressure. However we held firm and <b>came away with a welcome point</b> .</p>
  <p>Every other game was decisive and it's probably even closer now, with <b>only 9 points covering 3rd to 18th</b> in the table. We've slipped a couple of places to <b>13th</b> .</p>
