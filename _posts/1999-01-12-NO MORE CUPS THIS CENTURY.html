<p>It was nice while it lasted, but our glorious reign as the <b>best team in Birmingham</b> ended with a <b>2-1 defeat against Wolves in the B'ham Senior Cup</b> . They scored the winner in the last minute, with the Yeltz goal coming from <b>Ian Reed</b> . That's us out of all the cups now, so we can concentrate on achieving a nice, safe mid-table position in the League (please!)</p>
