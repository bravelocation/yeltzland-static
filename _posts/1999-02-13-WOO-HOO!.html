<p>
  <p>This was a <b>CRUCIAL</b> win in our relegation battle. A loss would have dropped us into the relegation zone, but two goals from young <b>Birch</b> and another two from <b>Pie-arce</b> has moved us up a couple of places in the table to a whopping 16th.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already heard, <b>Delton Francis</b> has been sold to Conference side <b>Kingstonian</b> for a fee of either £10,000 or £18,000 depending on who you listen to. The longstanding rumours of <b>Evran's problems</b> with the law have been proved true - he's <b>in court on March 8th</b> on drugs-related charges - so I've no idea who's going to playing up front soon.</p>
  <p>On a "brighter" note, the Halesowen News says <b>Hastings will be resigning from the Premier League</b> next season as their Mr Moneybags has pulled out, which should mean <b>one less team will be relegated</b> . Hopefully we won't be depending on this at the end of the season</p>
