match: WORCESTER 3 YELTZ 4

<p>
  <p>I'm not sure I can cope with this! <b>A third successive win</b> , 10 goals in all with an incredible 7 from <b>Stevo Piearce</b> .</p>
  <p>Things didn't look too good when Worcester took an early lead, and were two up by half-time. <b>Pie-arce</b> pulled one back soon after, but then we went 3-1 down when they scored again and were just about out of it. Unbelievably, <b>Paul Birch</b> got it back to 2-3, then <b>Stevo</b> got the <b>equaliser</b> and then a late <b>winner</b> and we'd won again. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Even more good news was the report in the <a href="http://www.newsquestmidlands.co.uk/newsgrp/stour/sport/htfc">Halesowen News</a> that <b>Harrow</b> are interested in taking <b>Paul Harding on loan</b> for a bit. Could things get any better?</p>
  <p>With several teams below us also winning it's crucial we keep this winning run going next week against Dorchester.</p>
