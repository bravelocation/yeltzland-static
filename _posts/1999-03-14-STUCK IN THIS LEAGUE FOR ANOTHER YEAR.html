match: Yeltz 2 Weymouth 2

<p>
  <p>Despite bravely fighting back from two goals down, it's now <b>impossible</b> for The Mighty Yeltz <b>to go up this year</b> .</p>
  <p>It was a reasonable game all in all. We gave them a <b>two goal start</b> with some <b>awful defending</b> , the second in particular a terrible mix-up between Forrest Gump and Danny.</p>
  <p>I must admit we we're on the way to the clubhouse for our usual half-time ablutions when <b>Rob Elmes finally scored his first</b> , but from all accounts he didn't know much about it when the keeper tried to clear the ball only to fire it straight against Elmesey. Still <b>he's deserved one</b> (at least) for his efforts in the last few games.</p>
  <p>We had much of the play in the second-half as we pushed for an equaliser, but it took and excellent move and a quality finish from <b>Ada Cooper</b> to get the point a few minutes before the end.</p>
  <p>Other news: Evran's court case has been adjourned again, and Catalogue Man scored for Harrow Borough.</p>
