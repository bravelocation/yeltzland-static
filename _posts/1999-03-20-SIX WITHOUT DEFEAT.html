<p>
  <p>The Mighty Yeltz continue their gradual climb to safety with <b>another draw</b> , this time against high-flying Ilkeston.</p>
  <p>We were twice in the lead, first after a goal from <b>Wayne Lloyd</b> . Then after they'd equalised just before half-time, we went ahead again after another from the unstoppable goal machine <b>Rob Elmes</b> . However, they got a late equaliser which means we're now in <b> 10th place </b> , 9 pts above the relegation zone.</p>
  <p>We've got <b>Bath next Saturday</b> , and don't forget it's a <b>1pm kick-off</b> because of the England game.</p>
