<p>
  <p>Another storming <b> hat-trick from Stevo Pie-arce</b> extended our unbeaten run to 8 games against local rivals <b>Tamworth</b> .</p>
  <p>Goals in the 2nd, 49th and 86th minutes means we're <b>back in the  top half of the table </b> again.</p>
  <p> <b>Congratulations</b> must (I suppose!) go <b>to Nuneaton</b> for clinching the title already by beating Atherstone. They've been <b>easily the best team</b> in what seems a mediocre bunch this year, and fully deserve to be back in the Conference after a long absence.</p>
