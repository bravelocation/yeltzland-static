  <p>The facts are as follows: In the <b>last 9 games</b> we now scored 6 wins and 3 draws, scored 27 goals, of which <b>16</b> were scored by the remarkable <b>Steve Piearce</b> . Hurrah!</p>
  <p>The latest win at Bromsgrove has sent them down to the Midland Division, and us up to 9th place , only 3 points off 4th. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>The supporters are <b>sponsoring the game</b> on Saturday in honour of it being <b>Sean's last game</b> before he moves to <b>Barcelona</b> , so here's hoping we send him off in style.</p>
