---

<p>
  <p>After a <b>long few months</b> of worrying whether we were going to get <b>relegated or not</b> , an 11 game unbeaten run has taken us up to an amazing <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=13041999">4th place</a> </b> .</p>
  <p>A brilliant 4-1 victory over <b>2nd placed Ilkeston</b> is our 4th win in a row, with goals from <b>Elmes, Piearce, Birch and Bradley</b> following an early Ilkeston goal. Hurraaaaah!</p>
  <p>We're now officially safe from the drop - all this and my lucky socks were in the washing machine.</p>
