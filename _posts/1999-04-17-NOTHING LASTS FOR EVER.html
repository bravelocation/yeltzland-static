  <p>I suppose it couldn't go on for ever, but it's a <b>shame</b> our long unbeaten run couldn't have lasted until the end of the season. A <b>2-0 loss at Gloucester</b> was a first loss in 12 games, but thankfully by now we're well safe from any relegation worries.</p>
  <p>
     <b>At the bottom</b> , Burton beat Dorchester 7-0 and other results mean <b>Cambridge</b> are in big trouble (), with the other two places looking to be between <b>Dorchester, Rothwell and Gresley</b> .
