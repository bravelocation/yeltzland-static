title: WHAT WE GONNA DO NOW?
match: Atherstone 0 Yeltz 2
---

<p>
  <p>An eventful and somewhat disappointing season was wrapped up with a <b>2-0 victory</b> at the <b>Atherstone dump</b> .</p>
  <p>Second half goals from <b>Rob Elmes</b> and from <b>Steve Pie-arce (confirmed as the league's top scorer)</b> means we finished in <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=01051999">8th place</a> </b> in the end - not brilliant but a lot better than it could have been when at one point we were in real relegation trouble.</p>
  <p>As usual, the last away game saw the Yeltz fans dressing up in all sorts of stupid costumes. The Jolly Boys hired limos for the day, and the highlight of the day was seeing the <b>Stourbridge bus</b> on the way home which resulted in ... well, I better not say ;-)</p>
  <p>So we enter the dark days of summer with the <b>prospects for next season looking very unclear</b> . It seems certain that Steve Piearce and Ian Reed will be leaving The Grove, and the club's financial situation means we're not really sure how we're going to replace them. I'll bring you any news I hear, so let me know if you hear any gossip, rumours etc.</p>
  <p>Have a jolly summer and I'll see you all next season.</p>
