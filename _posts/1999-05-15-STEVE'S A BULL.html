    It's been confirmed - according to several people who mailed me (thanks!) - that <b>Steve Piearce</b> has finally signed for <b>Hereford</b> .
    
  </p>
  <p>I got a nice <b>message from Steve on the  <a href="/haveyoursay/guestbook/">guestbook</a> </b> you might be interested in if you can find it amid all the crap I seem to be getting about the mighty Carlos these days.</p>
  <p>Still unconfirmed are the rumours that <b>Les Palmer</b> will be signed from Blakenhall, as well as <b>another much travelled striker</b> .</p>
  <p>More news if and when I get it (thanks again to everyone who's mailed me), but if you do hear anything <a href="mailto:poll@yeltzland.net">let me know</a> .</p>
