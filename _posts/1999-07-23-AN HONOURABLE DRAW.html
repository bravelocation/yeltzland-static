title: AN HONOURABLE DRAW
match: Yeltz 2 WBA 2
---

<p>
  <p>Honours were shared in the now traditional pre-season friendly against the <b>Albion</b> when the mighty Yeltz held their neighbours to a <b>2-2 draw</b> .</p>
  <p>The Baggies twice took the lead through ex-Kiddy star striker <b>Lee Hughes</b> , but both times we equalised with a first goal for new signing <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b> and one from <b>Crispy</b> .</p>
  <p>Previously, we had a disappointing <b>2-1 defeat at Cradley Town</b> , but to be honest, who cares? A few more meaningless friendlies are coming up before the start of the season proper on <b>August 14th at home to Dorchester</b> .</p>
