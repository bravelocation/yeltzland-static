<p>
  <p>The long and tedious build up to the season continues. We've beaten our squatters <b>Causeway United</b> 4-0, lost to <b>Kiddy</b> 1-0, tried out a few triallists and generally made a <b>reasonably good impression</b> . Not long to go now.</p>
  <p>I've finally managed to type in the <b> full fixture list </b> - if you haven't already seen it, the obvious highlight is the <b>last game visit to</b> the seaside at <b>Margate</b> .</p>
  <p>I'm sort of on holiday so apologies for the even patchier service than usual, although normal service should be resumed by the time we play Dorchester on the 14th.</p>
