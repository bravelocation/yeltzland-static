<p>
  <p>I think it's going to be a long season. <b>Three games, no goals</b> scored and another depressing <b>defeat - 2-0 at</b> previously pointless <b>Salisbury</b> .</p>
  <p>Our excellent goal difference means we've only slipped to <b>an impressive  18th place </b> in the table. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>We've got Grantham on Tuesday at The Grove and they've had an even worse start than us, losing all three of their games - surely we have to score then? Please?</p>
