title: ANOTHER BORE DRAW
match: Yeltz 0 Weymouth 0
---

<p>
  <p>Can you believe this? Another <b>0-0 draw</b> and the <b>excitement</b> level at The Grove is at an <b>all time low</b> .</p>
  <p>We've only scored in one game out of five now against bottom-placed and pointless Grantham. Computer predictions now say <b>if it goes on like</b> this by the end of the season we'll have scored 17 goals, have 42 points and be <b>getting crowds of about 200</b> .</p>
  <p>We now travel to Rothwell on Monday evening, followed by a match against Cambridge at The Grove on Saturday.</p>
  <p>BTW if you haven't already seen, we're away to either <b>Willenhall or Oadby</b> in the <b>FA Cup</b> 2nd Qualifying Round on Sept. 18.</p>
