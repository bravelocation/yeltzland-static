<p>
  <p>I'm really struggling to say something positive here and I'm not used to that. <b>Another loss</b> , this time to a poor <b>Cambridge</b> side - I have inside knowledge about them and they ARE poor - and we're hovering dangerously near the bottom with little promise of things turning around.</p>
  <p>We actually <b>took the lead</b> early on through <b>Ada Cooper's 2nd of the season</b> - he's equal top scorer now - but they equalised before the break and got a winner 15 mins. before the end. <b>The crowd</b> was once again right down to the <b>real hardcore fans</b> - only 433 this time.</p>
  <p>We've now travel to <b>Atherstone on Monday</b> , where we've done pretty well over the last few seasons. <b>COME ON</b> .</p>
