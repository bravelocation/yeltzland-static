<p>
  <p>All very strange - a team of defenders, Andy Crannage in goal (oh yes, the 45-year-old local celebrity) but <b>it really was Atherstone 4 Yeltz 5</b> .</p>
  <p>Ross Collins played in centre-midfield and Ralphy Crisp played up front but we doubled the season's meagre goal tally in one game, the scorers being <b>Ashley Brown (2), Crispy (2)</b> and another from <b>Ada Cooper</b> .</p>
  <p>We went behind to an early Atherstone goal, took a 3-1 lead but then conceded another before half-time. We then twice went two ahead, were twice pulled back to a single goal lead and eventually were very pleased to take all 3 points. Hu-bloody-rrah!!</p>
