title: YELTZ FIGHT FOR A POINT
match: Yeltz 1 Boston 1
---

<p>
  <p>In a very hard fought and often violent encounter, the mighty Yeltz continued their recent improvement with <b>a point against leaders Boston</b> .</p>
  <p>It was almost three points as <b>they only equalised late on</b> with a penalty after Danny McD had brought down one of their forwards when he was right through. <b>We'd earlier took a deserved lead</b> through a <b>Crisp penalty</b> after a blatant and stupid handball.</p>
  <p>We played excellently in the first half with <b>Evran Wright</b> , back for his 12th spell at the club, missing a couple of good chances. As the game went on some <b>fierce challenges</b> from both sides led to some <b>very heated debating</b> , culminating in the ref telling Woody and their centre-forward to sort things out behind The (bike) Shed after school. What larks.</p>
  <p>It's <b>FA Cup time</b> again, with next Saturday's trip to <b>Oadby</b> - it's a suburb of Leicester - in the 2nd Qualifying Round. We could do with a decent run.</p>
