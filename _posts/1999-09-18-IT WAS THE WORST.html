match: FAC2Q  - Oadby 2 Yeltz 1

  <p>I usually try and make an effort to put a positive slant on things, as there's enough people around who'll moan if they get half a chance. However this time I'm really struggling.</p>
  <p>They were rubbish. They're a West. Mids. League standard team if you can remember back to those days, and in the first half we outclassed them, <b>leading 1-0</b> at the break with a nice goal from <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b> .</p>
  <p>However, only one team seemed to remember it was the FA Cup in the second half. <b>They battled and scrapped</b> for everything and once they'd <b>snuck an equaliser</b> , we went completely to pieces.</p>
  <p>Whether it was because Birchy had got injured, but no-one (on our side) seemed to have any idea about what to do, and <b>it wasn't a great surprise when they scored the winner</b> . It was a sort of breakaway goal, but describing it like that gives the impression that we were mounting some kind of pressure at the other end.</p>
  <p>We were <b>desperate for a decent cup run</b> to spark the season into life, and now we're left feeling worse than ever. <b>Very poor</b> .</p>
  <p>If you've got anything to say about all of this, I'm sure there will be much discussion this week on the <b> <a href="/haveyoursay/mailinglist.asp">Yeltz mailing list</a> </b> .</p>
