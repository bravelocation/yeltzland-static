title: YELTZ GAIN FROM PAYNE
match: Halesowen 1 Crawley 0
---

<p>
  <p>After what feels like ages since we last played, the mighty <b>Yeltz won their second game on the trot</b> with a <b>1-0 victory</b> against struggling <b>Crawley</b> . However, only a late goal from on-loan Stuart Payne gave all three points against a team that had only had two draws so far this season.</p>
  <p>According to the <a href="http://www.thisistheblackcountry.co.uk/bc/stour/sport/halesfc/">Halesowen News website</a> we're looking to extend Mr. Payne's loan period as, what with the long break and his injuries, we haven't had him for many games. Anyway, he's got another chance to score on <b>Tuesday</b> when we meet <b>Ilkeston at The Grove</b> in the league.</p>
  <p>We've now snuck up to <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=23101999">13th place</a> in the league now and to be honest we're not that far off the top and the bottom.</p>
