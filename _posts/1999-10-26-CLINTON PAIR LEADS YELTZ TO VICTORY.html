  <p>My my! Things are looking better. A quick glance to your right and you'll see we've <b>won the last three games</b> . Hurrah!</p>
  <p>After a shaky start, <b>Clinton Thomas</b> has now started to find the back of the net, and goals in the 31st and 66th minutes set The Yeltz on their way against an in-form <b>Ilkeston</b> (they'd beaten Salisbury 6-0 on Saturday). A late third from <b>Darren Wright</b> capped what was probably the <b>best result so far</b> this season. They had a man sent off and arrived late because their coach broke down, but it's about time we had a bit of luck.</p>
  <p>We're off to Wales on Saturday when we visit <b>Newport</b> - don't forget that it's an <b>early kick-off</b> (12.15 I think) presumably because of the Rugby World Cup.</p>
