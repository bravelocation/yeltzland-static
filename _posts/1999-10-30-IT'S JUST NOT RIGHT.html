  <p>I suppose a lot of Welshmen like to watch the egg-chasing, but it still seems a bit bizarre kicking off at 12.15.</p>
  <p>It must have been a bit strange for the players too, but the mighty <b>Yeltz extended their unbeaten run</b> with a creditable <b>0-0 draw</b> with high-flying <b>Newport</b> . They've climbed up to second-place, and we've snuck into the top half of the table into <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=30101999">11th place</a> </b> .</p>
  <p>Elsewhere, DML teams had a pretty good day in the FA Cup 1st Round (remember that?!), with Ilkeston recovering from the stuffing we gave them to beat Carlisle 2-1, and Tamworth twice coming from behind to earn a draw against Bury.</p>
  <p> <b>I'm hoping to make a few improvements to the site this week</b> , so if things go a bit pear-shaped at times you'll know who to blame.</p>
