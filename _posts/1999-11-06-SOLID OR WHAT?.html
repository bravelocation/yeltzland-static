<p>
  <p>That's 4 games on the trot without letting any in now, and subsequently we've climbed to&#xD;
		a magnificent  10th place  in the table.&#xD;
		First-half goals from  <b>Matt Gardiner</b>  and  <b>Evran Wright</b>  set us well on our way,&#xD;
		with Evran scoring a third after the break.</p>
  <p>In a surprising and (slightly) dsappointing move,  <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b>  has been allowed to go&#xD;
		to  <b>King's Lynn</b>  for a "nominal fee". With Stuart Payne back at Kiddy, we're a little&#xD;
		short of cover up front now. Still, if Clinton and Evran keep doing the business it's not looking so bad.</p>
  <p>I've been  <b>tinkering with the site</b>  this week, so hopefully everything is working OK. The main new feature&#xD;
		is to let you lot to  <b>add your own match reports.</b> </p>
  <p>I'm finding it harder to get to Yeltz matches regularly, so I'm hoping&#xD;
		there'll be  <b>loads of you who want to contribute to the site.</b>  Simply click on the link below &#xD;
		and follow the instructions when you get there. Don't worry,  <b>you don't need to know HTML or anything</b> &#xD;
		 - just send your report and I'll do the rest.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Andi</h3>

  <p>A great game in the cold cold Halesowen air. Man of the Match was Clinton &#xD;
Thomas (could it be anyone else?) as he helped set up Evran (2) and Matty &#xD;
Gardner. A surprising absentee from the game was Richard Crisp, so Ashley &#xD;
Brown was recalled at right back.</p>
  <p>Somehow their number 4 didn't get sent off after continually fouling Clinton &#xD;
the whole game and was only booked. He also got Clinton booked.</p>
  <p>Adie Cooper cleared what would have been a consolation goal for Clevedon off &#xD;
the line. The result puts the Yeltz and 10th and drops me to 4th. (Fantasy &#xD;
Island)</p>
