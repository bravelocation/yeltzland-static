    That's 4 games on the trot without letting any in now, and subsequently we've climbed to&#xD;
		a magnificent  in the table.&#xD;
		First-half goals from  and  set us well on our way,&#xD;
		with Evran scoring a third after the break.

<h3>Match Report from Andi</h3>

  <p>A great game in the cold cold Halesowen air. Man of the Match was Clinton &#xD;
Thomas (could it be anyone else?) as he helped set up Evran (2) and Matty &#xD;
Gardner. A surprising absentee from the game was Richard Crisp, so Ashley &#xD;
Brown was recalled at right back.</p>
  <p>Somehow their number 4 didn't get sent off after continually fouling Clinton &#xD;
the whole game and was only booked. He also got Clinton booked.</p>
  <p>Adie Cooper cleared what would have been a consolation goal for Clevedon off &#xD;
the line. The result puts the Yeltz and 10th and drops me to 4th. (Fantasy &#xD;
