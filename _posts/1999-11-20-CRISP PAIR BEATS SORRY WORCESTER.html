match: Yeltz 2 Worcester 1
---

<p>
  <p>There was a lot of talk at the start of the season of Worcester being favourites for promotion.&#xD;
	I don't think our performance so far has been much to gloat about, but whereas  <b>we're solidly in mid-table,</b> &#xD;
	they are stuck second from bottom.</p>
  <p>An early penalty and a 70th minute winner from top scorer  <b>Richard Crisp</b> &#xD;
	 led to a welcome three points after a couple of defeats in the League. We've had some excellent &#xD;
	 <a href="http://vaio/news/addmatchreport.asp?date=20111999">match reports</a>  so far so hopefully more details will appear ASAP.</p>
  <p>Saturday puts us back on the Road to Wemberlee with the visit of Western Division  <b>Sutton Coldfield</b> &#xD;
	 to The Grove in the  <b>FA Trophy.</b>  I'm out of the country on business for most of the week, so if the site gets &#xD;
	updated even slower than usual, I can only apologise in advance.</p>
