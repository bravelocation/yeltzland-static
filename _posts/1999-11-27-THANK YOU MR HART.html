  <p>It's our best FA Trophy for years - getting through 2 rounds!</p>

    It was a strange game. We had loads of chances with young Payne being the most wasteful, and two the goals&#xD;
	we're due to ex-Yeltz star Mark Hart in the Sutton goal but it was reasonably easy in the end. Seeing I was&#xD;
	actually at the game for once you can read my &#xD;
