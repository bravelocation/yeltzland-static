<p>
  <p>On the positive side - we got a point away from home, kept a clean sheet and stretched our &#xD;
	unbeaten run to 4 games. On the other hand, we've still only won once away in the league.</p>
  <p>The quality of the match reports has been excellent so far, so hopefully one of &#xD;
	you brave souls who made the trip down there will file a  <a href="/news/addmatchreport.asp?date=04121999">match report</a> &#xD;
	telling us what actually happened.</p>
  <p>It's a free Saturday next weekend so you can get all your Xmas pressies with your conscience clear,&#xD;
	but before that we're away to  <b>Burton</b>  in the  <b>League Cup</b>  on Tuesday.</p>
