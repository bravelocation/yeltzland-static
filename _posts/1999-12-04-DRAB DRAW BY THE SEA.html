<p>
  <p>On the positive side - we got a point away from home, kept a clean sheet and stretched our &#xD;
	unbeaten run to 4 games. On the other hand, we've still only won once away in the league.</p>
  <p>
    The quality of the match reports has been excellent so far, so hopefully one of &#xD;
	you brave souls who made the trip down there will file a &#xD;
	telling us what actually happened.
