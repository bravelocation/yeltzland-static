<p>
  <p>First of all I'd like to wish everyone a  <b>Happy New Year,</b> especially those of you who've just&#xD;
	found us on your lovely new Xmas computers.</p>
  <p>It might be a new millennium, but I'm afraid the coverage here will be as up-to-date as ever :-(&#xD;
	However our first game of the century resulted in a very creditable  <b>2-2 draw</b>  away to old rivals &#xD;
	 <b>Gloucester City.</b> Goals from  <b>Cooper</b>  and  <b>Payne</b>  extended our unbeaten run &#xD;
	(in the League) to 5 games.</p>
  <p>Don't forget, if you were at the game and would like to add your opinion on what happened, why not send in&#xD;

<h3>Match Report from Andrew Simpson</h3>

  <p>On a cold and wet January afternoon the game got off to a stuttering start with niggly tackles &#xD;
and some dodgy decisions going against us. The game never got going until Gloucester made the breakthrough on &#xD;
44 minutes with a tap in. Halesowen replied instantly, Crispy crossing a great ball which Ada Cooper slotted home.</p>
  <p>The second half started well with another Crispy cross was slotted home cooly by Stuart Payne to make it 2-1,&#xD;
and he could have made it three when he slotted the ball wide in a one to one with the Tigers 'keeper Ryan Gallaway.&#xD;
The Yeltz hung on for 35 minutes with the Meadow Park pitch not helping City's attack with the ball sticking in the mud on &#xD;
numerous occasions. The Gloucester breakthrough finally came when the home side's number 4 headed home. &#xD;
The game finished in a skirmish with Wayne Lloyd killing almost all the home side!</p>
  <p>Team: McDonnell, Crisp, Owen, Wood, Lloyd, Collins, Wright, Payne, Gennard, Cooper, Smith - &#xD;
