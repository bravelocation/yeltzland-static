<h3>Match Report from Andrew Simpson</h3>

  <p>On a cold and wet January afternoon the game got off to a stuttering start with niggly tackles &#xD;
and some dodgy decisions going against us. The game never got going until Gloucester made the breakthrough on &#xD;
44 minutes with a tap in. Halesowen replied instantly, Crispy crossing a great ball which Ada Cooper slotted home.</p>
  <p>The second half started well with another Crispy cross was slotted home cooly by Stuart Payne to make it 2-1,&#xD;
and he could have made it three when he slotted the ball wide in a one to one with the Tigers 'keeper Ryan Gallaway.&#xD;
The Yeltz hung on for 35 minutes with the Meadow Park pitch not helping City's attack with the ball sticking in the mud on &#xD;
numerous occasions. The Gloucester breakthrough finally came when the home side's number 4 headed home. &#xD;
The game finished in a skirmish with Wayne Lloyd killing almost all the home side!</p>
  <p>Team: McDonnell, Crisp, Owen, Wood, Lloyd, Collins, Wright, Payne, Gennard, Cooper, Smith - &#xD;
Subs (not used) Brown, Cartwright, Donavan</p>
