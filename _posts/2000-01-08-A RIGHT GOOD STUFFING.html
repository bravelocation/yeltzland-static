title: A RIGHT GOOD STUFFING
match: Yeltz 0 Tamworth 3

<p>
  <p>Very disappointing. The first home game of the century brought local rivals  <b>Tamworth</b>  to The Grove,&#xD;
	where they gave us a comprehensive 3-0 roasting. Not the best of warm-ups for next week's big Trophy game&#xD;
	at Doncaster.</p>
  <p>This week brought another new forward to The Grove -  <b>Ian Olney</b> , formerly of Villa and Kiddy amongst other places.&#xD;
	Let's hope he'll soon be knocking them in, as we're still looking for a consistent finisher to replace old Pie-arce.</p>
  <p>The  <b>B'ham Senior Cup game at Boldmere</b>  has been rearranged to this  <b>Tuesday</b> &#xD;
	(7.30pm kickoff) before the big one	next Saturday.</p>
