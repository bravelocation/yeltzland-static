  <p>Genius. There's no point wasting effort on these local competitions when we've got the Trophy to concentrate on.</p>
  <p>Boldmere took the lead in the 81st minute, before Stuart Payne equalised almost immediately. This meant extra-time&#xD;
	(just what we wanted) and unfortunately a last minute winner for the home team.</p>
  <p>No need to remind you about the big one on Saturday - our 3rd Round FA Trophy game away to Conference side Doncaster.&#xD;
	COME ON!!!</p>

<h3>Match Report from Darren Marklew</h3>

  <p>Do you allow double figure scores in Fantasy Island?.</p>
  <p>This wasn't the greatest result before possibly the biggest game of the season&#xD;
(assuming we escape a relegation battle!). Yet again Danny saved us on several&#xD;
occasions but in all fairness we had two shots on target in 120 minutes and&#xD;
Boldmere deserved there win..</p>
  <p>The chap who gives Ashley Brown a lift to the matches (Jason Donovan or&#xD;
something like that!) played on the left and considering nobody has a clue who&#xD;
he is, he didn't do badly before being taken off for Jason Owen! Roll on&#xD;
Doncaster and lets hope we win 4-1 (cos I might predict that!).</p>
  <p>The team was : McDonnell; Brown; Donovan; Wood; Lloyd; Gardiner; Collins; Payne;&#xD;
Gennard; Cartwright; Crisp.</p>
  <p>Attendance: really was one man and his dog!</p>
