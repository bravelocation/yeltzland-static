title: FANTASTIC EFFORT AGAINST DONNY
match: FAT  Doncaster 1 Yeltz 1
---

<p>
  <p>In a fantastic battling performance, the mighty Yeltz earned a deserved replay with a &#xD;
	 <b>1-1 draw against Doncaster.</b> </p>
  <p>It was a scrappy first half, with Birchy, thankfully returning in midfield, influential but with no real chances at&#xD;
	either end. Then the vocal Yeltz following were rewarded by a goal from new bloke <b>Ian Olney,</b>  who coolly lifted&#xD;
	his shot over the advancing keeper.</p>
  <p>The lead lasted about 10 minutes, until they equalised with a spectacular effort for outside the box, and the&#xD;
	rest of the game was reasonably even, with us being under some pressure but looking dangerous on the break.</p>
  <p>There's some  <b>pictures of the game</b>  at one of the excellent Doncaster web sites at &#xD;

  <p>The replay's on Tuesday night at The Grove. Let's hope for a large and vocal support - we can do it!</p>
