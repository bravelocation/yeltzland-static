match: Havant 2 Yeltz 1
---

<p>
  <p>After the excitement of the Trophy, it's back to usual I'm afraid. Another disappointing away performance,&#xD;
	and we're left looking anxiously over our shoulders at the relegation zone.</p>
  <p>All the goals were in the first half, with the Yeltz one being scored by  <b>Stuart Payne.</b> &#xD;
	We're now down to 14th place in  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=22012000">the table</a> , just 8 points&#xD;
	above the bottom four. Hmmm.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, it's another away trip next Saturday, with a trip down the M5 to Clevedon.</p>
