match: Clevedon 0 Yeltz 0

<p>
  <p>On an extremely windy day, the Yeltz battled to a much needed point away at Clevedon. &#xD;
	The weather ruined the game, but they've had a pretty good record at home so it's not too bad.</p>
  <p>
    makes pretty worrying reading. The bottom 3 are really struggling,&#xD;
	but we're only 6 points above Crawley who hold that last relegation spot. The next two games, at HOME to Newport and&#xD;
	Merthyr are looking very important.
