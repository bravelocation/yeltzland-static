match: Clevedon 0 Yeltz 0

<p>
  <p>On an extremely windy day, the Yeltz battled to a much needed point away at Clevedon. &#xD;
	The weather ruined the game, but they've had a pretty good record at home so it's not too bad.</p>
  <p> The table  makes pretty worrying reading. The bottom 3 are really struggling,&#xD;
	but we're only 6 points above Crawley who hold that last relegation spot. The next two games, at HOME to Newport and&#xD;
	Merthyr are looking very important.</p>
  <p>There's been all sorts of rumours flying about saying Birchy is leaving for Â£20,000 to Bishop Auckland,&#xD;
being replaced by Robbie Slater. This seems particularly unlikely to me, but if anything happens as usual this site&#xD;
will bring you the news a couple of days late :-)</p>
  <p>I believe we have signed Steve Taylor, a forward and semi-pro international from Kiddy. With Ian Olney and Evran back in retirement, I reckon&#xD;
that takes our fit strike force back up to 3.</p>
  <p>There's an exciting new addition to the site this week - all the latest details of travel to away games brought&#xD;
	to you by the HTFC Travel Club. This is maintained by Kev who runs the club, so the information should be reliable.&#xD;
	Full details are on the  Travel Club  page.</p>
