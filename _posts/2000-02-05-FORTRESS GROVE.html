  <p>Back at the ranch, The Yeltz grabbed a much needed 3 points with a 2-0 victory against Newport. A  <b>Crisp penalty</b> &#xD;
	just before half-time and a second from  <b>the gas man</b> just after has left us looking a bit more comfortable&#xD;
	in  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=05022000">12th place.</a> </p>
  <p>We're due to play Solihull in the Worcester Senior on Wednesday. The Yeltzline didn't mention &#xD;
	anything about it, but thanks to everyone who've confirmed that the game is on (played at Redditch)</p>
  <p>Next Saturday is the annual visit of our Welsh friends from Merthyr. The Jolly Boys are playing their supporters&#xD;
	in the morning before the game, and we'll be hoping for our usual victory in both games :-)</p>
