  <p>Very disappointing. For a while it looked as though we were starting to improve, but a poor run since New Year&#xD;
	has left us only 6 points above the relegation zone with some tricky games coming up.</p>
  <p>Merthyr had been on an equally poor run, which makes it doubly disappointing, although from what I've heard&#xD;
	their victory was not undeserved.</p>
  <p>So it's just the small matter of Boston and Bath coming up. Well at least Fantasy Island should be a bit easier :-(</p>
