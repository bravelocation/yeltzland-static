<p>
  <p>Well it wasn't totally unexpected, but the manner of the defeat at league leaders Boston was very disappointing.</p>
  <p>3-0 down at the break following some pretty poor defending, things didn't get much better when Cartwright was &#xD;
	sent off for elbowing an opponent in the face. After that, we held them pretty well and even got one back with a &#xD;
	long-range effort from Ada Cooper, but they got a fourth near the end.</p>
  <p>
    Thanks to Ken Fox from the , we've got a couple of&#xD;
	video clips of goals from the game. See my for details

  <p>There's no game for a couple of weeks now until the visit of title-chasing Bath to The Grove. Things are looking good, aren't they :-(</p>
