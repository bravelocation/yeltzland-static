    We were never going to win them, but two losses against the league leaders has brought us toonly two points above the relegation zone.

  <p>On a happier note, a lot of us were out in Seville for Yeltz fan and Fantasy Island reigning champion Sean Jackson's wedding. I'm sure everyone would like to join me in wishing Sean and Reyes all the best for the future, and let's hope he can improve his defence of the title now the wedding's over :-)</p>
