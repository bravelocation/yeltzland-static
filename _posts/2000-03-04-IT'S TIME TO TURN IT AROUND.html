  <p>We were never going to win them, but two losses against the league leaders has brought us to <b>a critical time of the season</b> only two points above the relegation zone.</p>
  <p>The next 8 days brings games against fellow strugglers Worcester, Crawley and Atherstone. I know there's a lot of unhappiness amongst supporters about how things are going, but this isn't the time for that. <b>Let's get behind the team, manager, board whoever, get those points to make us safe and see how we can move on from there.</b> </p>
  <p>On a happier note, a lot of us were out in Seville for Yeltz fan and Fantasy Island reigning champion Sean Jackson's wedding. I'm sure everyone would like to join me in wishing Sean and Reyes all the best for the future, and let's hope he can improve his defence of the title now the wedding's over :-)</p>
