match: Worcester 0 Yeltz 0

<p>
  <p>We didn't score and we've still only won once this century, but the mighty Yeltz gained a gratefully received point at fellow strugglers Worcester.</p>
  <p>The next few days brings games against fellow strugglers Crawley and Atherstone. Crawley have climbed out of relegation zone with some excellent results recently, and Atherstone won their first game since September (and we thought we were bad) today against Ilkeston.</p>
  <p>
    I know there's a lot of unhappiness amongst supporters about how things are going, but this isn't the time for that.
