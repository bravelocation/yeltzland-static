match: Yeltz 0 Atherstone 1

<p>
  <p>Very very very poor. Losing 1-0 at home to Atherstone not only gave them some hope of saving themselves, &#xD;
but missed a crucial opportunity of hauling themselves away from the danger zone. &#xD;
With Grantham winning again, we are in big, big trouble.</p>
  <p>Well enough of you have asked for it, so although it's not the most positive of things to vote on, &#xD;
you can now register your thoughts on how the manager is doing.</p>
  <p>No game on Saturday - although the Yeltzline mentions a possible friendly at home to Tividale - &#xD;
then  <b>Salisbury</b>  are the visitors the Saturday after. Come On!</p>
