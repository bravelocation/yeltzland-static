  <p>Only a friendly today to give the players Mr Chambers doesn't like a run out. We won 5-0 as if that means anything.</p>

    More importantly, the other league results have dropped us to a brilliant . I don't think the results went too badly for us, with Crawley (who are on a tremendous run) beating Dorchester (who are as bad as us) and Atherstone losing as well (don't they always?).
