  <p>What a fantastic signing! Two goals in two victorious games from new bloke Ian Aldridge and we can start to 	breathe a little easier.</p>
  <p>Bath had lost their last two games, but this shouldn't take anything away from a crucial and to be honest unexpected victory. Boston look a shoe-in for the title now - Bath are 14 points behind with only two games in hand - but more importantly we're now 7 points clear of that last relegation spot.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings another difficult away game at Tamworth, but we go there in much better heart now. Come On!</p>
