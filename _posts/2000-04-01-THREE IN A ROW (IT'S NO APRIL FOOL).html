  <p>
    It's taken some time, but the mighty Yeltz have finally hit some form with three excellent wins in the league. &#xD;
	The latest victory was another away victory against a team near the top of the table, a 2-1 win at Tamworth. Goals from&#xD;
	Richard Crisp and returning favourite Ian Reed before the break means we're now 10 points above the drop zone and&#xD;
	in a healthy  in the table.
