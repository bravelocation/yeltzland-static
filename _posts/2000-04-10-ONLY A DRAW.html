<p>
  <p>After an amazing run of four wins, to be honest it's disappointing we only drew with Cambridge City. I guess that shows how much we've improved over the last few weeks. We're now up to  10th place  in the league and almost mathematically safe from relegation.</p>

  <p>Revitalised Halesowen enjoyed long spells of possession in the first half&#xD;
but lacked the killer touch in front of goal to secure victory and were&#xD;
ultimately forced to settle for a point.</p>
  <p>For the home side, Ian Cambridge beat Wayne Lloyd to the ball in the 21st&#xD;
minute, but Danny McDonnell was on hand to turn his effort away for a&#xD;
corner before Adam Salmons aimed a fierce diving header wide of the mark&#xD;
following an excellent cross from Neil Coburn three minutes later.</p>
  <p>In a flowing move with cross field interchanges between Jason Owen and Paul&#xD;
Birch, Halesowen's Ian Aldridge successfully lobbed goalkeeper Martin&#xD;
Davies in the 24th. minute but his effort struck the top of the crossbar.&#xD;
Three minutes later Aldridge's first time volley fell just wide after&#xD;
Davies had punched clear under pressure from Clinton Thomas.</p>
  <p>The visitors took the lead in the 38th minute after persistence from Ashley&#xD;
Brown allowed him to deliver an excellent right wing cross which was headed&#xD;
home by Thomas. With the home side pinned back in their own half, Steve&#xD;
Holden cleared Ian Reed's drive off the line and Davies tipped Wayne&#xD;
Lloyd's close range header over the bar before the half-time interval.</p>
  <p>Cambridge levelled in the 55th. minute when Player Manager Chris Tovey&#xD;
headed home a high cross in a crowded goalmouth. Halesowen's Neil&#xD;
Cartwright was then unlucky to see his 72nd. minute drive rebound into&#xD;
safety off the crossbar after his surging run from midfield and Matt&#xD;
Gardiner's drive into the net was ruled offside.</p>
  <p>The home side almost stole the points two minutes from time when substitute&#xD;
Chris Cleaver beat the offside trap and place the ball beyond McDonnell in&#xD;
the Halesowen goal, but Adrian Cooper raced back to scoop the ball over the&#xD;
bar.</p>
