  <p>Happy Halesowen bagged their eighth Easter goal to extend their remarkable &#xD;
end-of-season flourish with a comprehensive victory at second placed &#xD;
Burton.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz signalled their intentions after 11 minutes when experienced &#xD;
play-maker Paul Birch netted from a tight angle after Nick Goodwin parried &#xD;
Ian Reed's volley, but the goal was disallowed for offside. Burton &#xD;
gradually came into the game and the alert Danny McDonnell made two fine &#xD;
blocking saves from Christian Moore before Halesowen took charge to build a &#xD;
three goal lead.</p>
  <p>In the 30th minute, Birch played a lovely ball for Ian Aldridge to lob the &#xD;
Burton keeper, but the defensive clearance fell for Clinton Thomas to &#xD;
cleverly rifle home from 10 yards. Thomas and Reed then went close as the &#xD;
visitors turned up the pressure with Aldridge causing confusion for the &#xD;
Burton defence. Halesowen extended their lead three minutes before the &#xD;
break with a wicked 20 yard  Birch volley following Reed's corner.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz should have gone further ahead in the 58th minute when Reed's &#xD;
free kick struck the arm of Darren Stride and the referee awarded a &#xD;
penalty, but Reed's tame spot-kick was easily saved by Goodwin. With Burton &#xD;
struggling to make any impression, it was no surprise when Thomas powered &#xD;
in his second goal in the 73rd minute from another precise midfield pass &#xD;
from Birch.</p>
  <p>Halesowen almost unwound their good work when a hesitant defence watched a &#xD;
David Holmes left wing cross sail directly into the net in the 77th. minute &#xD;
and just two minutes later player manager Nigel Clough drilled home from &#xD;
the edge of the area, watched from the stands by famous father Brian.</p>
  <p>Agile Aldridge made the points safe for Halesowen in the 88th minute when &#xD;
he nipped in between the defence and goalkeeper Goodwin to net with a neat &#xD;
chip.</p>
