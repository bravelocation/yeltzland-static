  <p>The new season's getting closer and there have been a couple of draws for the FA competitions. In the  <b>FA Cup</b>  2nd Qualifying Round we're at home to  <b>Burton</b>  on Sept. 30, and in the  <b>Trophy</b>  we're at home to  <b>Bilston</b>  on Nov. 4 with the winners away to Ashton United or Solihull Borough on Dec 2. Not too bad all in all. Full details on both draws can be found at  <a href="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~paulc/">http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~paulc/</a> .</p>
  <p>More transfer news -  <b>Andy Quy</b> , a keeper with experience at Derby County has been signed from Hereford. He's only 24, and has had a few injury problems, but he seems like a promising replacement for Danny.</p>
  <p>Also, the ever reliable Halesowen News says we're giving a trial to 20-year-old defender John Newell from QPR. Pre-season training starts this week (Thursday 6th) so we might have a better idea exactly who's going to be around next year.</p>
  <p>There's a rash of  <b>new Yeltz web sites</b>  springing up at the moment. If you haven't already been there, why don't you check them out:</p>
