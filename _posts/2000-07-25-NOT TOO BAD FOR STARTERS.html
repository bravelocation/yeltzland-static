match: Yeltz 1 Hereford 1

<p>
  <p>OK, it was only the first friendly of the season, but it's a promising start.</p>
  <p>Plenty of details are now in from some excellent match reports (thank you all), although which new blokes are trialists and which ones of actually signed seems a little unclear (to me anyway). Our goal was scored by Mr. Hodgetts, the new blokes looked quite good and even Gary Piggott made an appearance!</p>
  <p>Next up  <a href="http://www.hednesfordtownfc.co.uk/">Hednesford</a>  on Saturday, then Cradley Harriers next Tuesday.</p>
