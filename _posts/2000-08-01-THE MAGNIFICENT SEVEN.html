<p>
  <p>A complete stuffing of our "local" rivals to keep them in their place. Goals from Payne, Mason, Dodds, Griffiths, Clinton, Darroch and an own goal lead to our biggest win since the last big one (you can find results for the last five seasons in  Anorak Corner  if you fancy looking - although I guessing it was before that)</p>
  <p>Saturday brings another Conference team to The Grove - this time old FA Cup rivals  <a href="http://www.telford.gov.uk/tufc/">Telford United</a> .</p>
