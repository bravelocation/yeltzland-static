<h3>Match Report from Dave Johnson</h3>

Dutton, Payne, Griffiths, Mason. Subs: Dodds, Thomas, Piggott, Owen, &#xD;
Darroch</p>
  <p>Causeway United: Sidaway, Powell, Taylor, Shilvock, Burley, Hancox, Mole, &#xD;

  <p>Referee: B. Green (Oldbury)</p>
  <p>Causeway made a lively start and a mix-up at the heart of the Halesowen &#xD;
defence in the 5th minute allowed Simon Dixon to nip in and poke the ball &#xD;
past Andy Quy to give the Grove tenants an early lead. Dixon then blasted &#xD;
high from 20 yards for Causeway before Halesowen's Michael Griffiths shot &#xD;
wide from 20 yards in the 13th minute and then saw his 20th minute header &#xD;
fly over the bar. The Yeltz eventually recovered from their shaky opening &#xD;
and equalised in the 39th minute when Craig Burley upended Michael &#xD;
Griffiths in the box and Richard Crisp tucked away the penalty past Matt &#xD;
Sidaway.</p>
  <p>Halesowen took greater control in the second half following five half-time &#xD;
substitutions and scored the winner in the 49th minute when Gary Piggott &#xD;
stooped to head home a left wing cross from fellow substitute Andy Dodds. &#xD;
Dodds then forced an excellent save from Sidaway in a quick Halesowen &#xD;
break six minutes later before Sidaway was on hand again to hold onto Craig &#xD;
Dutton's drive at the foot of the post on the hour.</p>
