  <p>OK, it's not quite technically true - we're only in  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=22082000"&gt;21st place</a>  with a bottom of the table clash against  <a href="http://www.margate-fc.co.uk/"&gt;Margate</a>  coming up on Saturday.</p>
  <p>We have got a whole bunch of new players, so we know it's going to take a bit of time for them to gel together, but let's hope this is going to happen sooner rather than later. If this bad start continues, I'd hate to think what the crowds will drop to. :-(</p>
