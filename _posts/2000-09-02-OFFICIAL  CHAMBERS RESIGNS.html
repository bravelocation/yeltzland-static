  <p>John Chambers resigned as manager of Halesowen Town after two years in &#xD;
charge at The Grove following another disturbing defeat against a Weymouth &#xD;
side without a win and suffering from a number of key injuries.&#xD;
Harry Rudge would have called it a "bad day at Black Rock" with another &#xD;
chapter in the history of HTFC about to close and all the pre-season &#xD;
promise finally turning to ashes.</p>
  <p>One bright spot was the form of goalkeeper Andy Quy who put in an another &#xD;
excellent display for the Yeltz. The tone of play for the afternoon was set &#xD;
in the 5th minute when Quy saved Martin Underhay's 15 yard drive. Quy went &#xD;
on to make further tremendous first half saves from Underhay and Darren &#xD;
Robotham with the visiting defence unable to close down the Weymouth &#xD;
attack. However, Quy had no chance as Weymouth took the lead in the 31st &#xD;
minute with the unmarked Ian Hutchison powerfully heading Anthony Tilley's &#xD;
corner home from 12 yards.</p>
  <p>In truth, apart from some early neat play, Halesowen lacked the &#xD;
organisation or balance to pose a serious threat to Weymouth, registering &#xD;
only one shot on target all afternoon. Ross Collins did well to rob the &#xD;
Weymouth midfield and set up Stuart Payne to easily slot home an equaliser &#xD;
in the 43rd minute.</p>
  <p>The brief period of hope for the Yeltz faithful disappeared as Weymouth &#xD;
took second half control and went back in front after five minutes of the &#xD;
restart. Quy saved Matthew Hare's goalbound drive from Anthony Tilley's &#xD;
freekick but the defence failed to clear the danger and Robotham was able  &#xD;
 to latch onto the rebound.</p>
  <p>John Chambers introduced Garry Piggott for Michael Griffiths and Andy Dodd &#xD;
brought short Craig Mansell's return to Weymouth, but the substitutions &#xD;
failed to breathe life into the Yeltz who fell further behind to two late &#xD;
goals. Matthew Gammon played a neat interchange with Robotham in the 72nd &#xD;
minute and Matthew Hale had the easy task of beating the exposed Quy from &#xD;
close range. It was no surprise when Hale added a fourth goal five minutes &#xD;
from time after being set up by Robotham again as Halesowen's heads dropped &#xD;
in despair at their dreadful start to the new season.</p>
