  <p>Well the manager left and not much changed. Another poor performance, another loss and we're only kept off the bottom of the table on goal difference.</p>
  <p>All the goals came in the second half, with ours a late so-called consolation scored by Mr. O'Goal. By all accounts they were all over us for much of the game. Very, very depressing.</p>

    It's the shareholders' meeting on Friday, which should prove quite interesting. As I'm one of the select few, I'll be attending so if anyone's got any (sensible) suggestions for questions  and I'll try and get an answer. Full report on proceedings next week.
