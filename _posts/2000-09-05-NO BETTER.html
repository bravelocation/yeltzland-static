  <p>Well the manager left and not much changed. Another poor performance, another loss and we're only kept off the bottom of the table on goal difference.</p>
  <p>All the goals came in the second half, with ours a late so-called consolation scored by Mr. O'Goal. By all accounts they were all over us for much of the game. Very, very depressing.</p>
  <p>It's the shareholders' meeting on Friday, which should prove quite interesting. As I'm one of the select few, I'll be attending so if anyone's got any (sensible) suggestions for questions  <a href="mailto:poll@yeltzland.net">mail me</a>  and I'll try and get an answer. Full report on proceedings next week.</p>
  <p>There's a   <b>new vote</b>   out now -  <b>who do you think should be the new manager?</b> . It's a mega list compiled with the help of DJ Yeltz, which I suppose reflects how there's no real favourites for the job.</p>
