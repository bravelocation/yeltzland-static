  <p>Things are definitely looking a bit brighter. A second win on the trot, this time through a late Wayne Lloyd winner against 10 man Stafford. We're still only in  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=19092000">20th place</a> , but at least we're not tailed off the bottom any more.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings bottom-placed Fisher to The Grove. Come On!</p>
