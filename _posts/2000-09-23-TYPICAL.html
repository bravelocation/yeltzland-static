    It was announced before the kick-off that . The two wins last week had obviously helped his case, but predictably we then went and lost to previously winless Fisher. Inspired.

  <p>Halesowen unveiled Alan Moore as their new manager just before the kick-off &#xD;
but then produced an embarrassingly weak performance to hand no-hopers &#xD;
Fisher their first win of the season.</p>
  <p>The Londoners took the lead on the half-hour when livewire striker Leroy &#xD;
Huggins controlled a long ball from defence before thumping a 15 yard drive &#xD;
past Andy Quy. Quy then punched clear from under his own bar when Hamad &#xD;
Barr delivered a troublesome corner. For Halesowen, Scott Darroch worked &#xD;
hard and sent two efforts wide of goal but it wasn't until the 58th minute &#xD;
that Fisher were troubled when a Ross Collins header was scrambled off the &#xD;
line by goalkeeper Maurice Munden.</p>
  <p>Fisher increased their lead in the 65th minute as Huggins took advantage of &#xD;
another long ball to finish clinically from 10 yards. Substitute Lionel &#xD;
Best then almost made it three with his first touch at the far post. Stuart &#xD;
Payne had a 78th minute header disallowed for offside and substitute Andy &#xD;
Hodgetts missed two late chances but in fairness Halesowen were lightweight &#xD;
in attack and will need to take a long hard look at themselves and how they &#xD;
can move on from here</p>
