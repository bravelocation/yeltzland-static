match: Yeltz 1 Dorchester 1
---

<p>
  <p>Well we still haven't won at "Fortress" Grove this season, and only just scraped a point against Dorchester through a late Wayne Lloyd goal. Full details in the  match reports .</p>
  <p>The latest news is  <b>Gary Hackett has been appointed Assistant Manager</b> . As I'm sure you know, Gary played for us for a few years after a long professional career. he's a Halesowen bloke, and I reckon will be an excellent appointment. Also, according to Dave J on the  mailing list , we were supposed to have signed striker  <b>Lee Bullimore</b> , but it all appears to have  <b>fallen through</b> .</p>
  <p>
    We've got a bit of a break from this depressing league action, as  <b>there's no game next Saturday</b>  as Welling are still in the FA Cup. Our next game is in the Worcester Senior Cup  <b>away to Worcester</b>  on Monday the 30th, and then it's the  <b>FA Trophy game at home to Bilston the Saturday after</b> .

  <p>As Halesowen searched for their first home win of the season, Dorchester &#xD;
seventh goalkeeper of the season Mark Ormerod had to race out of his goal &#xD;
twice within the first ten minutes but on both occasions he was beaten to &#xD;
the ball by striker Stuart Payne who was then unable to find the net. &#xD;
Ormerod then snatched the ball away from fellow striker Peter Sutton on the &#xD;
edge of his box as Halesowen again broke through in the 15th minute. At the &#xD;
other end, Dorchester man of the match Justin Keeler fired just over the &#xD;
bar after cleverly taking down Owen Pickard's pass in the 21st minute. In a &#xD;
scrappy first half, Ormerod was again on hand again to block a 28th minute &#xD;
effort from Payne who was put clear on goal by Sutton and Halesowen's &#xD;
goalkeeper Andy Quy turned away a 25 yard curling effort from Matt Lennon &#xD;
just before the break.</p>
  <p>The stalemate was finally broken in the 58th minute when Keeler waltzed &#xD;
through the home defence and the ball eventually fell invitingly for Matty &#xD;
Holmes to turn home from 8 yards beyond Quy. Halesowen introduced three &#xD;
late substitutes as they searched for an equaliser and it was Ross Collins &#xD;
who caused most trouble. Firstly he had a 76th minute effort disallowed for &#xD;
offside and then produced a tremendous right wing cross in the 86th minute &#xD;
but neither Ian Aldridge nor Michael Mason could produce the finishing &#xD;
touch. One minute later Halesowen equalised when defender Wayne Lloyd rose &#xD;
above everyone to power home a header from substitute Michael Mason's &#xD;
corner, leaving Dorchester to survive a last minute onslaught and share the &#xD;
points.</p>
  <p>In a final twist, it was later discovered that the travelling Dorchester &#xD;
fans managed to leave their huge Union Jack Dorchester flag at The Grove. &#xD;
Further developments involving a possible ransom demand for the return of &#xD;
the flag (Enigma machine style) can be expected.</p>
