  <p>It's always disappointing to lose, but I've never been a big fan of the Senior Cups so I can't say I'm too bothered.</p>
  <p>They took an early lead, we equalised through a Les Hines penalty, but then they scored again and with Woody being sent off that was it for our chances. Anyhoo, full details in the  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=30102000">match reports</a> </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, after the weekend's results we've slipped to  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=30102000">21st in the table</a>  at the moment. However, Saturday lets us forget about all that when old rivals Bilston come to The Grove in the FA Trophy.</p>
