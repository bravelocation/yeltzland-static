title: ROAD TO NOWHERE
match: FAT  Yeltz 1 Bilston 3
---

<p>
  <p>In a completely depressing performance, the mighty Yeltz failed to take any steps along the road to wherever the final's going to be this year.</p>
  <p>
    We were  and outclassed  who are currently top of the Midland and West Division. I can't remember their keeper making a single save, with our only threat coming from  who scored a screamer from 20-odd yards and hit the bar with a lob from about 40.

<h3>Match Report from James Pearson</h3>

  <p>In a hopeful mood I took a camera to the Bilston game expecting to take&#xD;
a few pictures of our strikeforce in action - I'd have been better off&#xD;
trying to catch a train in York at the moment. Jason's two strikes of&#xD;
brilliance (OK so one clipped the bar but at least one went in were too&#xD;
quick for me - unlike the multitude of Bilston attempts).</p>
  <p>I can't remember when there was such an absence of hope on both the pitch&#xD;
and amongst the crowd - I've seen more lively wakes! To criticise&#xD;
specific players is just taking easy pot shots - anyone who was there&#xD;
could write a book on the subject. With the exception of a brilliant&#xD;
display in goal (if you overlook positioning for their first goal) and&#xD;
Jason's performance there was a dirth of skill and effort. Collins at&#xD;
least tried but after his first half booking for a clumsy challenge&#xD;
looked restained, but in all fairness he was at the mercy of an&#xD;
unpredictable and whistle happy referee.</p>
  <p>I agree that we should always aim to get behind the players, but that is&#xD;
so hard when there is so little feedback from the performance on the&#xD;
pitch. While we all recognise that there are playing shortfalls in the&#xD;
current side they can be forgiven to an extent if those of us who pay&#xD;
over our money at the turnstiles can at least see the players trying.&#xD;
Effort is no substitute for skill and ability but, recognising the&#xD;
financial restrictions of the club, those of us who are realistic fans&#xD;
realise that the side cannot be shoffled like at deck of cards at the&#xD;
whim of the crowd or the manager. Given that, do not leave the dwindling&#xD;
few who are enduring this ongoing heartache whithout the crumb of&#xD;
comfort that effort would give us.</p>
  <p>To a degree I feel sorry for Scot Darroch. He appears like a fish out of&#xD;
water and stands out and the weakest link in a poor side. Having said&#xD;
that he is a youngster who needs compaetitive football to improve his&#xD;
skills. In a committed, enthusiastic team his odd errors could be&#xD;
compensated for and his abilities could develop. I am not saying he is&#xD;
the saviour of the side but he is just an example of the malaise within&#xD;
the side.</p>
  <p>The people who come to watch the side do not want to be critical. OK I&#xD;
am excluding the moaning few who have always been there and complained&#xD;
that the Joinsons were too slow and Sean Flynn should go back to&#xD;
bricklaying. We want to get behind the side but it is a two way thing.&#xD;
When the side give us a moment to cheer the volume increases, that rubs&#xD;
off on the players and the cycle begins. We are crying out to be&#xD;
inspired but at the moment there is more life in a Balti Chicken Pie&#xD;
than on the pitch. We want to enjoy going to the Grove, we want to cheer&#xD;
the players, we want to look forward to a Saturday afternoon - but at&#xD;
the moment is anyone, honestly, looking forward to next Saturday,&#xD;
without a feeling of dread in the pit of their stomach?</p>
  <p>Next Saturday I will drive to the game with a sense of optomism, the&#xD;
sickening feeling of yeasterday afternoon will have become a distant&#xD;
memory. Don't allow those memories to come back - try and you will be&#xD;
supported. In all of this I have not mentioned the management of the&#xD;
club. It was a difficult time to take charge of the club and funds must&#xD;
be limited, however if you give us passion and spirit those watching can&#xD;
forgive and look to future. Is is really too much to expect?</p>
