<p>
  <p>I know we've been on a terrible run recently, but we're actually  <b>the form team in the league right now</b> .&#xD;
7 points out of the last 9 have moved us up to  17th place in the table  and only 6 points behind 7th placed Cambridge. This is all ridiculously optimistic, but it shows  <b>there's still all to play for</b> .</p>
  <p>A first half goal from  <b>Ross Collins</b>  led to our first victory at the Grove for many, many years and finally moved us up out of the relegation zone. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Tuesday brings a trip to  <b>Bromsgrove</b>  in the League Cup, and then fellow strugglers  <a href="http://www.folkestoneinvicta.co.uk/"> <b>Folkestone</b> </a>  visit The Grove on Saturday in another important league game.</p>

  <p>It may have been flooding in other parts of the UK, but the Shed confirmed &#xD;
that there was a "bright golden haze on the meadow" at The Grove. Indeed, &#xD;
"the corn was as high as an elephant's eye" by 4:45pm as hearty Halesowen &#xD;
notched their first home win of the season and skipped above Tamworth and &#xD;
out of the bottom four.</p>
  <p>In the 13th minute, a Rob Warner corner was clawed away by Andy Quy who &#xD;
then saved Richard Clark's follow-up header. The Yeltz took the lead in the &#xD;
16th when a defensive clearance fell to the inspirational Ross Collins who &#xD;
cracked a 25 yard volley into the corner of the net leaving Darren Acton &#xD;
rooted to his goal-line spot in the Tamworth goal. As Halesowen's &#xD;
confidence built, Neil Cartwright broke quickly from Tamworth's 27th. &#xD;
minute corner and fed Peter Sutton who curled a shot just over. Cartwright &#xD;
supplied Sutton again seven minutes later but he could only shoot weakly at &#xD;
Acton.</p>
  <p>A generally disappointing Tamworth looked more lively in the second period &#xD;
and Halesowen had an early escape when Quy pushed away Nicky Carter's cross &#xD;
with Mark Turner unable to use the rebound. Turner then saw his effort &#xD;
turned around the post three minutes later as the Lambs searched for an &#xD;
equaliser. At the other end, Sutton turned well in the 63rd minute but &#xD;
blasted his effort over the goal. In the 71st minute substitute Christie &#xD;
McKenzie tricked his way through the home defence and set up former Yeltz &#xD;
boy Nick Colley, but his shot drifted across the face of goal. Cartwright &#xD;
scuffed a 76th minute effort but as tension rose around the ground, it was &#xD;
left to the Halesowen rearguard, marshalled by man-of-the-match Phil Wood, &#xD;
to secure the vital three points. Ten minutes from time Carter saw a 25 &#xD;
yard drive go agonisingly wide and then two minutes from time a shot from &#xD;
Houghton whipped across goal, but by the final whistle the Yeltz were &#xD;
confidently stroking the ball around down the other end.</p>
