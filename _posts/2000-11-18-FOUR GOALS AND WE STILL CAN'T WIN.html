title: FOUR GOALS AND WE STILL CAN'T WIN
match: Yeltz 4 Folkestone 4
---

<p>
  <p>You'd have thought it would've been enough.  <b>Two goals apiece from Sutton and Payne</b>  took us into a 4-1 lead, but  unbelieveably fellow strugglers Folkestone came back to earn what could be a vital point.</p>
  <p>Some more squad changes -  <b>Scott Darroch has been released</b>  after never really looking up to playing at this level, and with Ralphy Crisp and Craig Mansell almost back to full fitness.</p>
  <p> <b>Tuesday's game at Burton has been called off</b>  because stupidly the league arranged a representative fixture in the same week as a full list of fixtures. Doh!</p>
  <p>This means the next game is another important home league game - this time against  <b> <a href="http://www.jeff-eastmond.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ctafc/">Clevedon</a> </b> , who we've already beaten 4-1 this season. Come on.</p>
  <p>
    Another interesting snippet of news - to quote Dave Johnson on the  <a href="/haveyoursay/mailinglist.asp">Mailing List</a> :" <b>Halesowen legends Paul and Lee Joinson have signed for Causeway Utd.</b>  &#xD;
(Halesowen's tenants) at the age of 40. Lee played yesterday at Shawbury &#xD;
and both could feature against top of the table Warley Rangers on Wednesday &#xD;
evening at The Grove."However Kev Crook says:&#xD;
"Sorry to have to inform you that all is not has it seems.&#xD;
Both  <b>Paul and Lee played for Causeway veterans on Saturday</b>  against a Tamworth&#xD;
side in some annual cup competition. I do not believe that this team play on&#xD;
a regular basis and also do not believe that the twins have any desire to&#xD;
make a come back although they where asked to sign for Causeway after&#xD;
finishing with Sandwell. I would doubt that they would be making an&#xD;
appearance in their 1st team on Wednesday as they probably won't be able to&#xD;
walk until Thursday."
