  <p>After beating them 4-1 down at their place, hopes were high we'd complete our first double of the season. However, a reasonably disappointing draw kept us right down in the relegation fight in  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=25112000">17th place</a> . The Yeltz goal was another from the amazing  <b>Ross Collins</b>  whose now top scorer fro the season with 5.</p>
  <p> <b>More transfer news</b>  (although not officially confirmed): it appears  <b>Ian Aldridge</b>  has been released again, and  <b>Craig Mansell</b>  has returned to Weymouth after we paid to get him fit. Rumours of replacements include  <b>Sam Bowen</b> ,  <b>Lyndon Rowland</b> (!) and the two chaps mentioned below. More whenever I hear.</p>
  <p>We've got two away matches coming up. Next Saturday brings a first ever game against  <b> <a href="http://www.pvr.co.uk/wings/">Welling</a> </b> , then the Saturday after takes us to  <b> <a href="http://www.havantandwaterlooville.freeserve.co.uk/1.htm">Havant and Waterlooville</a> </b> , who have had 6 matches called off already this season.</p>
