  <p>Halesowen had rising star Ross Collins to thank for claiming a late point at their first ever meeting at ex-Conference outfit Welling despite controlling most of an exciting end-to-end encounter.</p>
  <p>The visitors had the better of a goal-less first half with Welling goalkeeper Glen Knight saving well from Les Hines in the 10th minute and Neil Cartwright in the 16th minute. As Welling gradually came into the game, Wayne Lloyd cleared the danger in the 24th minute by heading Dean Canoville's cross over his own bar. Andy Quy then gathered a 20 yard effort from Canoville just before the interval.</p>
  <p>Stuart Payne put the Yeltz ahead in the 64th minute when he inadvertently blocked a shot from Wayne Lloyd but he was able to latch onto the rebounding ball to beat Knight from close range.&#xD;
Halesowen then had several chances to increase their lead with Knight tipping a 25 yard effort from Les Hines over the bar and Peter Sutton blasting wide after the ball was laid into his path by Hines.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen then suffered a mini-collapse and found themselves trailing within the space of a minute. Quy could only parry a long drive from Lew Watts in the 70th minute and Zeke Rowe pounced to convert the rebound. Straight from the kick-off Welling scored again when Simon Glover's left wing cross was thumped home by Anthony Riviere. To their credit, Halesowen regrouped and were rewarded with a deserved equaliser three minutes from time when in-form Collins drove home from the edge of the box following more good work by Les Hines.</p>
