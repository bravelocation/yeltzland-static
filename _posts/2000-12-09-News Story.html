<p>
  <p>As half expected, the recent awful weather meant that the trip down to Havant and Waterloovile was called off due to a  <b>waterlogged pitch</b> . At least they had an early inspection to save people making the long trip. Although Tamworth beat Margate,  <b>we're still in  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=09122000">17th place</a> </b> .</p>
  <p>Tuesday brings surprisingly high-flying  <b>Moor Green</b>  to The Grove for a second round  <b>League Cup tie</b> . We've never really done anything in this competition, and seeing as it's the only cup we're left in it would be nice to get a result.</p>
  <p>Then on Saturday our old friends  <b>Merthyr</b>  are our visitors. It looks like the annual supporters game might not be taking place - I think the Jolly Boys are feeling their age a bit nowadays - but I'm sure we'll have a few drinks together before and after the game.</p>
