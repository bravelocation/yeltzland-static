<p>
  <p>The seemingly non-stop rain meant another game was called off - the League Cup tie against Moor Green has now been  <b>rearranged for next Tuesday (December 19th)</b> .</p>
  <p>Another match that will have to be rearranged is the game at home to  <b>Weymouth on January 13th</b> , as they're still in the Trophy (thanks to Darren Marklew for pointing that one out).</p>
  <p>More transfer news:  <b>we've signed Stuart Corns</b>  from Unibond side Droylesden, a 22 year old utility player.</p>
  <p>On Saturday our old friends  <b>Merthyr</b>  visit The Grove. It looks like the annual supporters game won't be taking place - I think the Jolly Boys are feeling their age a bit nowadays - but I'm sure we'll have a few drinks together before and after the game.</p>
