    Our long(ish) unbeaten run in the league came to an abrupt end with a . A goal just before half-time, and two just after from the confusingly named Cambridge meant we've now slipped to a depressing  in the table. Not a very Merry Xmas :-(

  <p>Halesowen failed to cope with a heavily sanded pitch and were well beaten with Ian Cambridge causing the damage for his namesake team.</p>
  <p>A poor first half came to life on the half-hour when Adam Wilde finished a &#xD;
great run from midfield with a 15 yard shot that was saved by Andy Quy, &#xD;
with Phil Wood clearing for a corner. In a rare moment of danger for the &#xD;
home side Richard Crisp fired into the side netting in the 43rd minute when &#xD;
Stuart Payne's header left goalkeeper Martin Davies stranded out of his &#xD;
goal. However, within a minute Cambridge went ahead when giant striker &#xD;
Tesfaye Bramble turned two Halesowen defenders and crashed the ball into &#xD;
the net off the underside of the crossbar.</p>
  <p>Cambridge controlled the second half and it no was surprise when they &#xD;
increased their lead after 55 minutes. Richard Crisp managed to clear a &#xD;
header from Steve Wenlock off his own goal line, but as his defence &#xD;
hesitated to clear, Ian Cambridge was able to convert from close range.</p>
  <p>Quy made another fine blocking save from substitute Kevin Wilkin who broke &#xD;
clear in the 63rd minute but could only watch as dangerman Ian Cambridge &#xD;
then rattled the crossbar twice in five minutes with two identical 20 yard &#xD;
shots. Striker Cambridge turned home the third goal in the 70th minute from &#xD;
a left wing cross with the visiting defence torn apart.</p>
  <p>In the dying minutes, Neil Cartwight's shot was saved by Davies and a Ross &#xD;
Collins effort was cleared off the line as Halesowen searched for a &#xD;
consolation.</p>
