match: Yeltz 1 Worcester 3

<p>
  <p>Another bitterly disappointing loss - this time against local rivals Worcester. We were 2-0 down early on, were never really in it and Bowen's late goal was no consolation at all. More details in the  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=26122000">match reports</a> .</p>
  <p>On Saturday (30th) we finish off a very disappointing year with a game at home to  <b>Ilkeston</b> , and then on New Year's Day we visit  <b>Moor Green</b> .</p>
  <p>As I'm on holiday until after the New Year,  <b>the site might not be updated as regularly as usual</b> , but I'll do my best to keep things reasonably recent. Anyhoo, have a jolly Xmas and New Year, and let's hope 2001 brings us better results that 2000 did. :-)</p>

  <p>Halesowen slumped into deep relegation trouble as they were unable to &#xD;
recover from giving injured-ravaged neighbours Worcester an early two-goal &#xD;
advantage.</p>
  <p>Worcester stunned the home crowd with an opening goal in the 3rd minute &#xD;
when Michael Wyatt collected a short pass from former long-term Yeltz &#xD;
servant Andy Bradley and curled a shot into the corner of the net from the &#xD;
edge of the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Home defender Andy Comyn limped off the field in the 15th minute and &#xD;
seconds later Worcester took full advantage when Wyatt put Mark Owen clear &#xD;
on goal and he was brought down by Andy Quy with the home defence caught &#xD;
napping. Leading marksman Owen then stepped up to make no mistake from the &#xD;
penalty spot.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started the second half in more determined fashion but found no &#xD;
way through the Worcester rearguard and their possession continually broke &#xD;
down in the final third of the pitch.&#xD;
Another ex-Yeltz favourite Danny McDonnell raced off his goal line to beat &#xD;
Peter Sutton to the ball in the 55th minute and then thwarted Ross Collins &#xD;
by clawing away his shot two minutes later.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes from time Worcester substitute Carl Tranter produced a super &#xD;
finish from Mark Owen to make the points safe. However, the home side &#xD;
eventually claimed an 87th minute consolation when the ex-Worcester &#xD;
maverick striker Sam Bowen slotted home from close range after a cross from &#xD;
Les Hines had caught out the visiting defence.</p>
