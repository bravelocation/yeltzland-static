Hmmm.

  <p>Saturday brings the start of a  <b>long run of away games</b>  (although with our home form the way it is this might be a good thing) with a crucial relegation battle at  <b>Tamworth</b>  - weather permitting of course.</p>
  <p>P.S. Now the holidays are over normal service should be resumed on the site. Apologies for the lack of updates over the last few days, but not a lot happened really.</p>
