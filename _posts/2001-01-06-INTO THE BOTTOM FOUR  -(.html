title: INTO THE BOTTOM FOUR  -(
match: Tamworth 3 Yeltz 2
---

<p>
  <p>A crucial game - and after coming from behind to lead 2-1 we ended up with nothing.</p>
  <p>With  <b>Steve Pie-arce back on loan</b>  for a month, we travelled slightly more hopefully than in recent weeks, but were deservedly 1-0 down at half-time. We then finally started to play a bit of football and  <b>unbelievably took the lead through two excellent John Ford goals</b>  - a shot from the edge of the box and an excellent header when left unmarked. Unfortunately we couldn't hold on; they equalised not long afterwards and then got a sickening winner from a free-kick in the 94th minute.</p>
  <p>Desperately looking for something good to say, I suppose Pie-arce looked pretty sharp with very little service and  <b>new signing Costas Xiourouppa</b>  (pronunciation to be determined) made a promising debut. However the bad news is we've  slipped back into the relegation zone  and really are in dire straits (a pun may be added here if/when I cheer up a bit).</p>
  <p>Next Saturday, it's now been confirmed we're back at "Fortress Grove" for the rearranged game  <b>at home to Ilkeston</b> .</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Corns (Xiourouppa 38), Hines, Owen (Ford 55), Lloyd, Collins, Cartwright, Piearce, Bowen (Sutton 72), Smith, Crisp</p>
  <p>Referee:  D. Adcock (Long Eaton) Attendance: 602</p>
  <p>With both teams enduring a troubled season, this crunch meeting promised a &#xD;
repeat of the recent history of dramatic games and goals between the two &#xD;
sides at the Lamb. The game was given added spice with Halesowen enthused &#xD;
by the return of Yeltz-hero and goal-ace Steve Piearce from Hereford Utd &#xD;
and Tamworth's Caretaker Manager Caretaker Manager Tim Steele taking charge &#xD;
for his first game following the insensitively timed dismissal of Paul &#xD;
Hendrie so soon after his brutal street attack.</p>
  <p>However, a forgettable first half of little creativity or tactical &#xD;
awareness revealed why both teams are surprise strugglers at the foot of &#xD;
the Dr Martens Premier this season and the game was only brought to life &#xD;
when Tamworth took the lead in the 22nd minute with right fullback Rob &#xD;
Warner lashing home a cross from David Foy from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>Stuart Corns picked up an early injury and after signalling to the bench &#xD;
for several minutes was finally replaced by the splendidly named new &#xD;
capture Costas Xiourouppa from Bolton Wanderers who went on to reveal some &#xD;
neat first touches. Tamworth then almost wrapped up the game when a &#xD;
speculative shot caught out Andy Quy but rebounded off his right-hand &#xD;
upright. Despite a frail looking Tamworth defence, it was nearly halftime &#xD;
before the potentially potent strike force of Sam Bowen and Piearce &#xD;
combined with Piearce sending over a right-wing cross for Bowen to head &#xD;
into the side netting from an acute angle.</p>
  <p>A sizzling second half began with Quy making an excellent point blank save &#xD;
in front of goal, before Halesowen staged a remarkable fight back. The &#xD;
injured Jason Owen was replaced by Jon Ford who was only on the field for a &#xD;
few moments before scoring two goals within four minutes. In the 61st &#xD;
minute Ford collected the ball on the edge of the penalty area and his 20 &#xD;
yard shot beat Darren Acton to creep into the corner of the net. With &#xD;
renewed self belief Halesowen went ahead when Xiourouppa cleverly took two &#xD;
defenders out of the game before laying off the ball, allowing the &#xD;
resulting cross to be powerfully headed home by Ford.</p>
  <p>However as the strong contingent of travelling fans found their voice and &#xD;
contemplated the prospect of opening up some daylight between themselves &#xD;
and Tamworth in the league table, Halesowen once again lacked the &#xD;
resilience to hold onto a vital lead and conceded another two late goals in &#xD;
this must-win game. In the 76th minute, the ball was lost cheaply on the &#xD;
right wing, and ex-Stourbridge forward Christie McKenzie whipped over a &#xD;
cross for Mark Hallam to equalise from close range. Kicking down the slope, &#xD;
the goal inspired Tamworth who pressed forward and were awarded a late &#xD;
freekick on the edge of the penalty area which Foy cracked home for the &#xD;
winner with 94 minutes showing on the stopwatch.</p>
  <p>Ominously, with half the league programme now complete, Halesowen have only &#xD;
won four games and would seem to require ten more victories to ensure &#xD;
safety in what is arguably a more difficult second part of the season. &#xD;
Individually, Halesowen would seem to have enough talent and experience in &#xD;
the current squad for the task ahead but it's not happening for them as a &#xD;
team at present and it's time for everyone to pull together and understand &#xD;
their own role in the arduous but mouth-watering task ahead.</p>
