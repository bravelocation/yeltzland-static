  <p>It's getting so desperate that I've having to make predictions of doom like that above - hoping that as my predictive powers are so bad (check out  <a href="/haveyoursay/fantasyisland/scores.asp">my score in Fantasy island</a>  if you're not convinced) it'll save us.</p>
  <p>This was another awful loss, going down to a goal just before half-time. That's only 4 points from the last 8 games, we're now in  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=13012001">20th place</a>  and unless things start changing soon we really do have no chance of staying up.</p>
  <p>Next week brings a trip to  <a href="http://www.crawley-town-fc.demon.co.uk/">Crawley</a> , who are currently in 5th place but have only won one in the last seven. Well you never know :-)</p>
