  <p>Another good result - postponed has been about the best we can do recently. It's going to mean a long midweek trip later in the season, but we're bound to be in better form by then :-)</p>

    More squad changes I'm afraid -  couldn't get to training because of travel/work stuff and the poor bloke has joined Atherstone. Also,  "is still working away from home and cannot train mid-week" which is the official version of why he left that everyone's sticking to.
