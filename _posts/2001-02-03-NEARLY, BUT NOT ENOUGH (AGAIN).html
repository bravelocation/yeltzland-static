title: NEARLY, BUT NOT ENOUGH (AGAIN)
match: Yeltz 2 Welling 2
---

<p>
  <p>A fighting performance, but the mighty Yeltz dropped another 2 crucial points in an increasing desperate relegation battle.</p>
  <p>
    A first-half  goal put us into a lead we held until the 78th minute, and despite  scoring an excellent goal from a tight angle with only 6 minutes left, we once again threw a lead and important points away. With other teams winning again (Fisher, Tamworth - for no bonus points what's the connection between those two?) , now 5 points from the safety zone.

  <p>Despite an improved battling performance Halesowen remain bottom of the &#xD;
table and paid dearly for letting Welling equalise twice to claim a draw. &#xD;
The game once again highlights that Halesowen's plight is due to a &#xD;
miserable home record and their continual failure to hold onto winning &#xD;
positions.</p>
  <p>The visitors quickly adjusted to the muddy playing surface and Halesowen &#xD;
had an early escape when Zeke Rowe was judged to be offside when he slotted &#xD;
home after a dangerous run by Anthony Riviere in the 23rd minute. But it &#xD;
was Halesowen who took the lead in the 35th minute when Jon Ford held off &#xD;
the Welling defence before laying the ball into the path of new signing &#xD;
Nicky Carter and his low cross was turned into the net by Wayne Lloyd from &#xD;
two yards out.</p>
  <p>The high-flying Wings levelled in the 78th minute when Matt Bower struck a &#xD;
dipping shot into the roof of the net from 20 yards out. In an exciting &#xD;
ending, Halesowen regained the lead in the 84th minute through a tremendous &#xD;
individual effort by on-loan Steve Piearce who fought off three defensive &#xD;
challenges before lashing the ball past Glen Knight from an acute angle. &#xD;
However, just three minutes later Halesowen let a vital lead slip again &#xD;
when they failed to clear their lines and then backed off from Riviere who &#xD;
worked through the penalty area to beat Quy.</p>
  <p>Halesowen almost grabbed a third in a frantic injury-time goalmouth &#xD;
scramble that saw Andy Comyn and Ford miss close range efforts whilst at &#xD;
the other end Wayne Lloyd made an important last gasp tackle to prevent &#xD;
Rowe winning the game for Welling.</p>
