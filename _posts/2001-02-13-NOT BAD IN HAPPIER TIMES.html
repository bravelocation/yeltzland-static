  <p>An excellent result really considering our current form, but despite only losing 1-0 away to the league leaders unfortunately it's another step closer to the relegation. More info on the game in the  match reports .</p>
  <p>Saturday will be the start of  <b>the long march</b>  to safety with victory at The Grove against 4th placed  <b>Salisbury</b> .  <b>We ARE going to stay up, and the turning point WILL be on Saturday</b> .</p>
