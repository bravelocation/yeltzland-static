<p>
  <p>Just like the old days. A dynamic performance from the mighty Yeltz blew Salisbury away to give us some hope (at last) of avoiding the drop.</p>
  <p>
    We started positively right from the start, with young Skidmore and Smithy particularly excellent in the centre of midfield. We had most of the pressure and  when  headed home from a well-flighted Crispy free-kick.
