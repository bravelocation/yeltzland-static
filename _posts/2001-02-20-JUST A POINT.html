match: Havant 0 Yeltz 0

<p>
  <p>A hard fought point. By all accounts it wasn't much of a game, with neither team looking much like scoring. I guess three points would have been better, but at this stage any points are better than none.  <b>We're still  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=20022001">bottom</a> </b>  and with Folkestone winning at Burton we're still a long way from safety, but at least we're battling.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings the second leg of this epic road trip we're on at the moment with a long trip to the flatlands of  <b> <a href="http://www.kingslynnfc.co.uk/">King's Lynn</a> </b> . A win would be lovely, please.</p>

  <p>Hard-working Halesowen were full value for a crucial point at in-form Havant and Waterlooville who had bagged 12 goals in winning their previous &#xD;
3 home games. Inspired by captain Neil Smith, the visitors closed down &#xD;
their hosts at every opportunity and restricted their goal-scoring &#xD;
attempts.</p>
  <p>Sam Bowen volleyed wide from a Les Hines freekick in the 4th minute for the visitors and a minute later Dean Blake blasted wide at the other end in a &#xD;
sterile first period.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's resilience continued in the second half with youngster Stuart Skidmore tenacious in midfield and Costas Xiourouppa producing some &#xD;
dangerous attacking runs. Blake managed another half-chance before Richard &#xD;
Crisp cleared Ben Price's cross off the toe of Jamie O'Rourke in the 62nd &#xD;
minute. The Yeltz then had a spell of domination and Paul Nicholls saved &#xD;
well from Bowen midway through the second half after a clever combination &#xD;
between Costas Xiourouppa and Crisp.</p>
  <p>The Hawks almost snatched a winner with the best chance of the game in the 78th minute when O'Rourke met Price's cross but his looping header &#xD;
rebounded off the inside of Andy Quy's post, allowing the Halesowen defence &#xD;
to hack clear.</p>
  <p>Halesowen introduced Peter Sutton and Paul Lloyd as late substitutes and held firm for a point in their third encouraging display in row in which &#xD;
only one goal has been conceeded.</p>
