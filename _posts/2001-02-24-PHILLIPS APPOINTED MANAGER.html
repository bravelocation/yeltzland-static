  <p>Ex-Nuneaton Borough supremo Brendan Phillips takes over the Halesowen &#xD;
hot-seat from the unlucky Alan Moore who saw his improving side battle back &#xD;
for a late equaliser after appearing to be in control early on.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started brightly and it was no surprise when they took a 16th &#xD;
minute lead against a weak looking home side. Jon Ford sent a long ball &#xD;
forward from the halfway line which beat the home defence and Peter Sutton &#xD;
had the easy job of rounding goalkeeper Chuck Martini before side-footing &#xD;
into the net.</p>
  <p>However, the Yeltz allowed the Linnets back into the game with their first &#xD;
real effort on goal in the 26th minute. Andy Quy only partly punched clear &#xD;
a free-kick from the troublesome Dave Puttnam and the ball fell invitingly &#xD;
for Glen Fuff to hammer into Quy's unprotected net from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>The home side went on to take the lead four minutes into the second half &#xD;
when Puttnam's through ball beat the Halesowen rearguard and Simon Bush &#xD;
slotted home from the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen reduced to their last 10 fit squad players in the latter &#xD;
stages, King's Lynn went close with a close range flick through ex-Yeltz &#xD;
forward Lyndon Rowland and had a penalty appeal by Fuff turned down in the &#xD;
67th minute.</p>
  <p>With 12 minutes remaining, Les Hines stunned the home crowd and grabbed an &#xD;
important point for Halesowen when he curled a 20 yard free-kick into the &#xD;
top corner with goalkeeper Martini stranded on the rocks.</p>
