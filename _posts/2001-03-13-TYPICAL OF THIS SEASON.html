  <p>I could have copied one of many news items from this awful season here and it probably would have been reasonably accurate.</p>
  <p>We played pretty well, fought back from a goal down to lead 2-1 (goals from new bloke and new bloke), but still managed to lose via a late-ish penalty and a last minute winner after we'd missed a sitter.</p>
  <p>That makes it a wonderful 10 points from the last 18 games. We can still stay up, especially as we've got a relatively easy run in but I reckon we'll need at least 17 points from those last 10 games. Trouble is we've been saying similar things for weeks and the equation just gets harder and harder.</p>
  <p>Take the opportunity to do something fun this weekend - thankfully we've got no game on Saturday. Unfortunately it's more stress next Tuesday when Weymouth visit The Grove.</p>
