title: ANOTHER NAIL
match: Yeltz 0 Weymouth 2

<p>
  <p>It isn't going to happen. Another loss in a game we just had to win, and despite playing reasonably well at times that's 4 losses in a row and  <b>we're deservedly bottom of the league</b> .</p>
  <p>We looked quite dangerous in the first half and we were a little unlucky to be behind - but how often have we said that recently? In the second half we never looked like getting back into it, and a late second for the visitors killed off any hopes of recovery. With Folkestone beating Dorchester  <b>we're now 10 points from safety with only 9 games left</b> .</p>
  <p> <b>Saturday brings a long trip to fellow strugglers Dorchester</b> , stoopidly still kicking off at 3pm despite the England game being on at the same time. This really is the last chance, but to be honest even if we do win it's unlikely we can get safe. Still, positive vibes and all that.</p>
