match: Yeltz P Havant P

<p>
  <p>This year's awful weather claimed another victim, as our crucial home game against Havant was called off after a deluge just before kick-off made the pitch unplayable. According to the Yeltzline,  <b>the game has been rearranged for Thursday April 26th</b> .</p>
  <p>Other results couldn't have been much worse with Folkestone beating Clevedon and Dorchester winning too. We're now  <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=07042001">9 points from safety</a> </b>  and probably now  <b>need to win at least 6 out of the last 7 to stay up</b> .</p>
  <p>Tuesday means a long trip (except for me!) down to  <b>Crawley</b>  in another game we have to win. The weather in Sussex has been as bad if not worse as anywhere else, and with the forecast not good there must be some doubt already about the game. However, both Crawley and Havant are really struggling to complete their remaining games, so we've really got to play if we can.</p>
  <p>Congratulations to  <b>Les Hines</b>  for being voted  <b>player of the season</b>  by all of you. The sad person who cracked the minimal security to try and vote 80 times for Neil Smith unfortunately failed because I just fiddled the vote back again to give the correct result. The masses's will cannot be denied.</p>
