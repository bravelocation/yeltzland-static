title: WHY DO WE PUT OURSELVES THROUGH THIS?
match: Yeltz 0 Moor Green 2

<p>
  <p>Thankfully it's nearly all over now. If Folkestone beat Fisher on Monday and we lose to Worcester us statisticians can happily pronounce it all wrapped up.</p>
  <p>Let's not kid ourselves - we are the worst team in the league. After Tuesday's good performance we were truly awful yesterday, and a hard working Moor Green put us to shame.</p>
  <p>So it's on to Worcester tomorrow (7.45 kickoff) which would be a terrible place to go down. Not that it makes much difference really, because it's going to happen sometime in the next couple of weeks. What joy.</p>
