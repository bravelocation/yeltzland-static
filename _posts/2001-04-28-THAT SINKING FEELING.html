  <p>The Jolly Boys are trying to sort something out between us of getting at least one entry, but I think this is a brilliant idea - let's try and get as many businesses or fans or whoever to do this and get as much money raised as possible.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Fisher Athletic: Iga; Aris, Manning, Bircham, Edwards, Taylor, Powell, Tydeman, Tyne, Mighty (Moore 67), O'Neil. Subs: Cohen, Pacey</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Turbutt; Skidmore, Burnham, Lloyd (Wood 14), Owen (Sutton 23), Smith, Crawford, Ince, Spencer, Bailey, Hines. Sub: Thomas</p>
  <p>Booked: None Referee: M. Knight (Hove) Attendance: 129</p>
  <p>Halesowen's season-long lack of fire power came back to haunt them as they &#xD;
failed to turn long spells of pressure into goals at rain-soaked Fisher. &#xD;
However, for all Halesowen's lack of punch, Fisher fared even worse and &#xD;
gave emergency goalkeeper Scott Turbutt an easy afternoon's work in the &#xD;
Halesowen goal.</p>
  <p>A dismal first half left the sparse crowd in no doubt why both sides are &#xD;
already condemned to relegation. Central defenders Wayne Lloyd and Jason &#xD;
Owen were early injury casualties but the only attempts on goal came when &#xD;
Fisher's Ross Edwards almost turned a backpass into his own net and Yeltz &#xD;
youngster Andy Spencer hit a cross from Les Hines over the bar on the &#xD;
half-hour.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were well on top after the break but could not convert their chances to leapfrog above Fisher in the table. Hines curled a 20 yard &#xD;
free-kick just high in the 58th minute before Spencer had another trio of &#xD;
efforts in increasingly treacherous conditions. His 59th minute diving &#xD;
header went just past the post and he then broke clear to hit a hard cross &#xD;
along the face of goal after an hour before drilling wide again in the 70th &#xD;
minute. Andy Iga turned a shot from Michael Crawford wide and Crawford then &#xD;
saw his 78th minute goalbound header stick in the mud.</p>
  <p>For all their efforts Halesowen remain bottom of the table and must be crying out for a younger version of one of their legendary goal-scoring heroes from the past.</p>
