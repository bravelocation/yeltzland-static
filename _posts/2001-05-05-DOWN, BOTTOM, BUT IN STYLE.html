  <p>It's all over. It were the worst, but we finished of an awful season on a positive note with a  <b>2-0 win over Bath</b> , both goals coming from young  <b>Dennis Bailey</b> .</p>
  <p>In the circumstances, things do look reasonably positive.  <b>Brendan Phillips has signed a two year contract to remain manager</b> , which is  <b>very good news</b> . Since he's took over we've looked a much better team, even though we didn't get the results the improvement deserved.</p>
  <p>We're very excited about the possibility of having some sort of Jolly Boys logo on the shirts next year. We're just putting together a major consortium to enter into the brilliant lottery scheme to raise sponsorship money (see  here  for details - at the bottom of that page).</p>
  <p>Obviously the site will be updated less frequently over the summer months, but I'll try and keep everyone up-to-date on everything I know, so keep on sending me anything you know or post it on  YeltzTalk . It's going to be a lot harder next season to maintain the site as we won't be on Ceefax any more, but I'm hoping to make some major-ish changes to the site before August if I can find the time.</p>
  <p>Thanks to everyone who's sent me news and gossip over the last year; personally I can't wait for our promotion season next year already :-)</p>
