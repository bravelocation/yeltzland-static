  <p>Firstly, the friendly against Alsager has been replaced by a 'fun' day at The Grove plus a friendly against Causeway. Also, the  <b>League Cup</b>  draw has been made - we're away at  <b>Bilston</b> .</p>

  <p>It's believed that the Boxing Day/Easter Monday games will be against the mighty Stourport Swifts. Brings it home how we've fallen, doesn't it?</p>
