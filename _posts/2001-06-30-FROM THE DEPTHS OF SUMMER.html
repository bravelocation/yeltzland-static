<p>
  <p>Another brief update as there's been a few more things happening recently.  <b>If you want more details</b>  during the summer, keep an eye on  <b> <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk"&gt;YeltzTalk</a>  or subscribe to the  <a href="/haveyoursay/mailinglist.asp"&gt;Yeltz Mailing List</a> </b> .</p>
  <p>There's huge excitement in these parts as Monday July 2nd brings the big  <b>shirt sponsorship raffle</b> . The Jolly Boys have 2 tickets out of 50 (cost £200 each) and if we get picked in a 'Crinkley Bottom' style draw we get our logo on the kit this year. A brilliant idea, and I really hope we win. The draw's in the club on Monday evening.</p>
  <p>The  <b>new blue kits are out</b>  (logoless at the moment of course) and can be ordered from the club for£32 shirt, £15 shorts. More financial news - To watch the mighty Yeltz's promotion charge next season will cost  <b>£5.50 for home games</b> . We've got the money for the  <b>new floodlights</b>  from the Football Trust, and will have a lovely pylons at each corner of the ground. We're also getting more cash in from having a  <b>mobile phone mast</b>  near the halfway line, presumably off the pitch on the side.</p>
  <p>We've signed Lee Collins, brother of Ross from Moor Green and two forwards, Kerry Giddings and Andy Jones. The squads still a bit unknown at the moment, but we'll try and bring you a reasonably complete list as soon as someone can work it out.</p>
  <p>Not long now. First friendly is on July 14 against old friends Causeway.</p>
