  Another brief update as there's been a few more things happening recently.  <b>If you want more details</b>  during the summer, keep an eye on

       <b>The club's new sponsors will be Plumbing World</b>  - owned by Stourbridge Town Chairman Mark Serrell. After Ron Moseley had won the raffle, he generously offered to auction it off, and Mr. Serrell bid a further Â£2000 to win. All in all, a brilliant scheme by the club which I believe has raised more money that was received from Hamer Ford last year.</p>

       <b>The Jolly Boys syndicate</b>  invested the remains of their funds into  <b>sponsoring Stuart Skidmore's kit</b>  for the season, and I guess we're taking it in turns to wash it.</p>
