title: WE'RE OFF
match: Friendly  Yeltz 2 Causeway 1
---

<p>
  <p>First friendly out of the way - a  <b>2-1 win against tenants Causeway United</b>  with a team of young triallists, the goals being scored by  <b>Alfie Carter</b>  an ex-Walsall striker due to train up at Rochdale this week.</p>
  <p>The week's other main story is the bizarre news of  <b>a Halesowen player starring in the Champions League. Tim Clarke</b>  has been loaned out to Barry Town for their European campaign, and played a major part in their 2-0 first leg win. If they get through, I believe they play Porto in the next round.</p>
  <p>Next game is on Saturday with a friendly against Stourbridge Town that I'm sure they'll make a lot more of than we will.</p>

  <p>Halesowen manager Brendan Phillips used the first outing of the season to run the rule over a number of on-trial youngsters. And it was ex-Walsall &#xD;
striker Alfie Carter who impressed most, notching two goals in a narrow &#xD;
victory over ground-share outfit Causeway United of the Banks's Premier.</p>
  <p>Carter struck the post from a free-kick in the 13th minute before giving Halesowen an 18th minute lead by calmly slotting home a cross from Ryan &#xD;
Asher-Powell in a move started by Clinton Thomas.</p>
  <p>Causeway produced a sweeping attack on the half-hour when Ian Kirkham broke down the left but Simon Dixon side-footed his cross just wide. Matt &#xD;
Richards then headed Anthony Baker's cross into the arms of Halesowen &#xD;
goalkeeper Mark Garvey's just on half-time.</p>
  <p>Causeway's line-up had a familiar feel from last season, although &#xD;
substitute strike pair Paul Parker and Adan Eveson, both signed from Lye &#xD;
Town, caught the eye in the second period. Eveson equalised in the 67th &#xD;
minute with clever chip over goalkeeper Garvey. But the Yeltz youngsters &#xD;
restored their lead three minutes later when Thomas put Carter clear on &#xD;
goal to finish superbly to cries of "Get Carter!" from the terraces. A late &#xD;
lob from Parker fell just wide and Carter almost completed a hat-trick in &#xD;
the last minute but he hit straight at substitute goalkeeper Siddaway from &#xD;
close range.</p>
