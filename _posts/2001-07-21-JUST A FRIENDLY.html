    Nothing to get too excited about, except perhaps the amazing size of our squad at the moment. A 0-0 draw against local sort-of rivals Stourbridge Town and a chance to assess lots of potential new players. If your interested, DJ has added a full .

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Piearcy; Skidmore (Colwell 45), Burnham (Carter 45), Taylor (Bradley 45), Knight (Shaw 65), L. Collins (Barnett 45), Hall (Jones 45), &#xD;
Crawford (Gallagher 75), Spencer, Bailey (Donaldson 65), Hines (Otto 45). &#xD;
Sub: Garvey.</p>
  <p>Stourbridge: Arnold; Black, A. Dodd, Hamilton, R. Dodd, I. Jones, Gray, M. Jones, Baker, Watson, Pulisciano. Subs: Casson, Briscoe, Dale, Blake.</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Weaver (Warley)</p>
  <p>Halesowen named a strong starting line-up, captained by Lee Collins. The only absentees were Kerry Giddings and Neil Smith (holidays), Tim Clarke &#xD;
(Champions League duty) and Ross Collins (thigh strain). The Yeltz also &#xD;
used the opportunity to unveil the new all-blue home kit, ironically &#xD;
sponsored by Stourbridge chairman Mark Serrell's company, Plumbing World.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen struggled to break the stalemate with Stourbridge and the Midland Alliance visitors deservedly earned a draw. The Halesowen strikeforce could not take advantage of Les Hines and Matty Hall whipping &#xD;
over early crosses from each wing and in the 15th minute it was &#xD;
Stourbridge's Nathan Pulisciano who met a long cross from Mark Jones, but &#xD;
his header curled just wide of the mark. Hall produced several good runs &#xD;
from the right wing for Halesowen during the game, but his 25th minute &#xD;
effort ended with a weak shot.</p>
  <p>Stourbridge's best chance fell in the 57th minute when ex-Conference striker Brian Gray made an incisive run but his shot was gathered at the &#xD;
foot of the post by goalkeeper Jason Piearcy. A misunderstanding between &#xD;
Piearcy and Lee Knight then almost gave Stourbridge a breakthrough in the &#xD;
61st minute. Ten minutes later the Glassboys substitute Leon Blake turned &#xD;
well but shot just wide.</p>
  <p>With a much changed Halesowen line-up in the final quarter, Andy Jones drilled wide and Jim Arnold in the Stourbridge goal saved a lob from Andy &#xD;
Spencer before Ricky Otto went close to converting a late right-wing cross.</p>
  <p>Halesowen now go forward to meet West Bromwich Albion at The Grove on Thursday 26th July, kick-off at 7.30pm.</p>
