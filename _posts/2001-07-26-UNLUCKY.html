  <p>In a promising performance against a pretty strong Albion side, the mighty Yeltz were a little unlucky to lose 1-0 to the First Division side. Much more detail as usual in  DJ's match report .</p>
  <p>The friendlies are coming thick and fast now, with a trip to Stratford on Saturday, followed by a shorter one on Tuesday to the Harriers. Just 3 weeks to go now until the real thing.</p>

  <p>Halesowen made the early running against a stronger than expected Baggies line-up and Neil Smith headed a Les Hines cross into the arms of Brian &#xD;
Jensen in the 11th minute. Jensen then raced off his line to beat Kerry &#xD;
Giddings to the ball after a clever flick from youngster Andy Spencer.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz missed a glorious chance to take the lead on the hour when skipper Lee Collins touched the ball to Andy Jones but he blasted his &#xD;
chance high from close range.</p>
  <p>Albion were forced to work hard but won the game in the 65th minute as Jordao calmly slotted a left wing pass beyond Jason Piearcy with Halesowen &#xD;
exposed for the first time.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz pushed hard for a late goal and substitute Ricky Otto hit the bar from Andy Spencer's looping cross in the 70th minute. Lee Knight then &#xD;
brought a fingertip save out of substitute goalkeeper Chris Adamson and &#xD;
Adamson was kept busy with two curling efforts on target from Otto and a &#xD;
drive from Alfie Carter.</p>
