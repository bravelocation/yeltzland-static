<p>
  <p>Another experimental team, but things do seem to be coming together a bit. Goals from  <b>Giddens, Taylor, Donaldson and Otto</b>  led to a convicing 4-1 victory - and it's nice to see us knocking a few in. More details, as ever, in the  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=28072001">match reports</a> .</p>
  <p>You might have missed - and be vaguely interested in some  <b> <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=26072001#photos">photos from the Albion game</a> </b> , like the squad photo here provided by Dave Johnson (Thanks!)</p>
  <p>This week's friendlies include a trip down to the Tanhouse Stadium to meet the Harriers on Tuesday, then down South to play Ryman League Harrow Borough on Saturday. Exotic!</p>
