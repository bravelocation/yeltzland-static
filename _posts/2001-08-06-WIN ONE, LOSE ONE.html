  <p>The friendly season is in full swing now, with just 2 weeks (hurrah!) to the start of the new season. Saturday brought an amazing 5-5 draw at Harrow Borough - full details in the  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=06082001">match reports</a>  section.</p>
  <p>Then on Monday we lost 2-1 to 3rd Division - and doesn't that still sound strange? - Kidderminster. We went one down to an early goal, two down just after the break before getting one back through Dennis Bailey (yes he is back).</p>
  <p>Some disappointing new yesterday:</p>
  <p>Onwards and upwards - two friendlies left now. Blues visit The Grove on Wednesday, and then Boston United are the visitors on Saturday.</p>
