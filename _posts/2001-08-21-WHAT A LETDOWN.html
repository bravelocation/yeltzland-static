title: WHAT A LETDOWN
match: Sutton Coldfield 2 Yeltz 0
---

<p>
  <p>After Saturday's uplifting victory, us long suffering Yeltz fans were forced back to reality with a very disappointing 2-0 loss at last year's strugglers Sutton Coldfield. Two late goals, the second from ex-Yeltz player Mark Bellingham ended what was by all accounts a poor game on a poor pitch. This season suddenly doesn't look so attractive. Ho hum.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us down to Chippenham Town, where hopefully we can get back to winning ways.</p>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Gray, Hall, Giddings, May, Taylor, Crawford. Subs: Spencer, G. Smith, Hines.</p>
  <p>Referee: P.J. Keane (Wolverhampton)</p>
  <p>Halesowen received a rude wake-up call against a Sutton side who finished third bottom last term but dug deep and battled away to register an &#xD;
unlikely win thanks to two late goals.</p>
  <p>Coles Lane appears to have changed little in the eleven years that have elapsed since last hosting the Yeltz in a league game and although the &#xD;
match programme noted recent pitch improvements, the surface was still &#xD;
below what we have come to expect on our travels. Yet these are the sort of &#xD;
games where Halesowen need to turn possession and silky skills into points &#xD;
if they are to be challenging for honours next Spring.</p>
  <p>Sutton's Dominic Reece hit just over as early as the 4th minute, but very &#xD;
little was then seen of the home side in a game Halesowen should have &#xD;
wrapped up well before half-time. Leroy May headed Matty Hall's cross over &#xD;
in the 7th minute and Saturday's hero Kerry Giddings turned to bring a fine &#xD;
save out of ex-Stourbridge goalkeeper Darren Alden after 39 minutes.</p>
  <p>Alden had an entirely average season between the sticks at Stourbridge last &#xD;
term but was on tip-top form as Halesowen sought out a winner in the second &#xD;
period. Tipping over Mark Taylor's goalbound shot in the 50th minute he &#xD;
then produced another top-drawer save from Michael Gray on the hour.</p>
  <p>Tim Clarke saved well when Nathan Moran broke clear in the 54th minute, but &#xD;
with the Royals suffering injury, cramp and tiredness late on, the Yeltz &#xD;
failed to take advantage and as time went on a scoreless draw seemed the &#xD;
most likely outcome.</p>
  <p>To their credit, the Royals battled away before pouncing in the final five &#xD;
minutes as Halesowen's midfield caved in. Even so, Sutton's 86th minute &#xD;
opener was a bad goal to concede. Halesowen lost the ball deep in Sutton's &#xD;
half and a long ball forward caught out the Yeltz defence. With Clarke &#xD;
initially in two minds he came, but did not get, allowing Leon Mitchell to &#xD;
beat him to the ball and calmly slot into an open goal.</p>
  <p>Ex-Halesowen striker and Copper Mark Bellingham arrested any lingering &#xD;
Halesowen hope deep in injury time when he turned on the edge of the box &#xD;
and fired low into the bottom corner. Manager Brendan Phillips was clearly &#xD;
heard venting his frustration at his players in the centre-circle in the &#xD;
after-match warm-down.</p>
