title: LEAVING IT LATE
match: Chippenham 2 Yeltz 2
---

<p>
  <p>A late penalty converted by  <b>Les Hines</b>  salvaged a point for the mighty Yeltz in what was by all accounts another pretty poor game down at Chippenham.</p>
  <p>We'd taken  <b>an early lead, again through Les</b>  but from a deflected free kick that left the keeper with no chance. However they soon equalised from the spot - although my correspondent has no idea why it was given. He said  <b>we had the better of the play</b>  before they took the lead on the break midway through the second half.</p>
  <p> <b>Bank Holiday Monday brings Redditch to The Grove</b>  (7.45pm kickoff I believe). We played them a few times over the last few years in various cups, but let's hope we can reproduce last week's excellent home form again and get the three points. It's going to take time for the team to gel, but let's hope it doesn't take too long.</p>
  <p>If you're interested, I've gradually been updating parts of the site. The  <a href="/stuff/roughguide.asp">Rough Guide</a>  now has a feature giving maps of most of the various grounds around the league. Enjoy.</p>
