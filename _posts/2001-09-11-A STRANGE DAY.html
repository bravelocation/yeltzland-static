    I feel a little bit strange writing about football after the events in the USA today. Anyway, a very good win for the mighty Yeltz added to the strangeness of the day. Goals from Les, OG, Rossco and a late one from Giddings led to a fourth win on the trot. We're now , just two points behind leaders Solihull Borough.

  <p>The lights went on over the Grove when Halesowen tested their new superb &#xD;
Â£65,000 floodlights after the 4-0 win over Rocester to move into a top &#xD;
three spot in the league table.</p>
  <p>In a surprisingly fast and furious first half, Rocester's Andy Bourne hit a &#xD;
fierce first minute shot which Tim Clarke turned away for a corner. Les &#xD;
Hines, who raced up and down the left wing tirelessly all night, then hit a &#xD;
cross over to Leroy May a minute later and Andy Spencer's 14th minute cross &#xD;
was cleared for a corner from Jason Burnham's long ball out of defence. &#xD;
Rocester played their part in a first half of open, flowing football and &#xD;
almost took a 26th minute lead when Rob Myatt's cross was headed down by &#xD;
Andy Bourne, but the ball just escaped Russell Dematteo in front of goal.</p>
  <p>Halesowen went ahead and took control of the game in the 44th minute when &#xD;
Ross Collins was fouled on the edge of the area and Les Hines struck a &#xD;
sweet free-kick directly into the top corner. Three minutes after the break &#xD;
Nick Anthony lobbed an own goal past his own goalkeeper under pressure from &#xD;
Leroy May for Halesowen's second.</p>
  <p>With Rocester's spirit broken, Halesowen created a host of second half &#xD;
chances. May's 55th minute shot was tipped away for a corner and May then &#xD;
latched onto Neil Smith's long ball in the 66th minute but steered his shot &#xD;
just wide. Ross Collins headed Halesowen's third goal in the 71st minute by &#xD;
bundling the ball over the line from another Hines corner, with Andy &#xD;
Spencer was on hand to crash the ball further into the net.</p>
  <p>Halesowen scored a tremendous fourth goal in the 84th minute when Andy &#xD;
Jones raced down the left and sent a pinpoint cross for fellow substitute &#xD;
Kerry Giddings to rush in and head home. Rocester substitute Mick Stark was &#xD;
denied a consolation a minute later when his shot struck the post.</p>
