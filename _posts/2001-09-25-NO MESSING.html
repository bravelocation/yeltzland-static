  <p> <b>Six clean sheets in a row. Is this some kind of record?</b> </p>
  <p>An early goal from  <b>Andy Jones</b> , and then two more late on from  <b>Kerry Giddings</b>  and  <b>Jones again</b>  led to yet another 3 points. We've now moved up to  <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=25092001">3rd in the table</a> </b> . Things are going very well aren't they?</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us back to  <b>Moor Green in the FA Cup</b> , which will be a good test of our progress so far this season. Unfortunately I'm pretty confident :-)</p>
