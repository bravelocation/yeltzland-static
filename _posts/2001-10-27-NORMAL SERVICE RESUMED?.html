<p>
  <p>Much more like it. The mighty Yeltz got back to winning ways by beating old rivals Atherstone through a first half goal from  <b>Andy Jones</b> . The reports I've received say we dominated possession without creating many chances, but as ever  <b>it's the three points that matter</b> .</p>
  <p>We've climbed up to  <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=27102001">5th place</a> </b> , just 3 points off the top with games in hand on everyone above us.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us to the far North West to meet Northern Premier side  <b>Barrow in the FA Trophy</b> . Barrow are currently 6th in their league, but appear to have gone off the boil a bit recently so we've got a chance to cause an upset. Their website is at  <a href="http://www.barrowfc.com/">http://www.barrowfc.com/</a>  if you're interested.</p>
