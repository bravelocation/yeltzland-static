  <p>We're certainly getting through them. Another chance to roll out the 'Let's concentrate on the league' rubbish as we went out of the League Cup to a last minute Bilston winner. We always seem to do badly in this competition, so who cares really?</p>

    If you haven't been following the discussion on , there's been a lot of talk of setting up a supporters' fund for new signings. Chairman Nigel Pitt has called a meeting for any interested parties to talk about it  next Monday (19th) in the clubhouse at 8pm.

  <p>Halesowen bowed out of the Dr Martens Cup at the first hurdle with a &#xD;
disappointing last minute defeat at financially troubled Bilston.</p>
  <p>Manager Brendan Phillips elected to use several fringe squad players and &#xD;
Ross Collins went close for the Yeltz in the first minute when he burst &#xD;
forward, but the makeshift striker slotted wide of the post. Michael &#xD;
Crawford then drove wide from 20 yards in the 11th minute. Without the &#xD;
influence of Mark Taylor, the Yeltz lost the ball in midfield on several &#xD;
occasions and in the 27th minute it led to Bilston's Mark Habbershaw &#xD;
flashing an effort wide of Tim Clarke's upright. Les Hines delivered a &#xD;
cross of quality on the half-hour to Andy Jones but his header fell just &#xD;
wide of the post. Four minutes later Hines went on a solo run but his shot &#xD;
from 20 yards dipped just over the bar.</p>
  <p>The second half continued in a similar pattern with little prospect of a &#xD;
goal although a shot from Hines was whistling into the net until deflected &#xD;
for a corner by Bilston defender Dave Benton in the 55th minute. Alfie &#xD;
Carter then saw his header fly over the bar from substitute Matty Hall's &#xD;
cross and a 67th minute throw-in from Hines was headed on by Kerry Giddings &#xD;
but Carter struck the side-netting. Hall broke clear in the 70th minute but &#xD;
his shot was deflected for a corner by Steve Hillman. Andy Spencer then hit &#xD;
a good chance against the legs of goalkeeper Matthew Boswell in the 86th &#xD;
minute after being set up by Carter.</p>
  <p>As an attacking force, Bilston had little to offer until the 89th minute &#xD;
when Tim Clarke made a great save to deny a Leon Jackson header. A minute &#xD;
later Jackson hit the winner from 6 yards out when Clarke's defence failed &#xD;
to clear - at least the Yeltz faithful were spared 30 minutes of extra-time &#xD;
on a bitter Bilston night to forget.</p>
