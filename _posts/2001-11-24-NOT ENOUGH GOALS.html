title: NOT ENOUGH GOALS
match: RC Warwick 0 Yeltz 0
---

<p>
  <p>We've only scored 5 goals in our last 6 league games, and it's a bit worrying. If Les had scored a first half penalty we might have snuck three points at Warwick, but as it was all we got out of the game was a point in a 0-0 draw.</p>
  <p>I'm sure evryone's as concerned as me that simply being solid at the back isn't going to be enough to get us up. However, I'm also sure Brendan is on the case, as can be shown by his attempts to make a move in the transfer market. I have every confidence that it will get sorted.</p>
  <p>
    Anyway, it's not really that bad. We're still right in the hunt in  and have an important game at Stourport on Tuesday. We stuffed them at The Grove earlier in the season, so let's hope for more of the same at their place.

  <p>Halesowen's season is in danger of faltering as they once again struggled to find the net despite dominating their opponents and being awarded a &#xD;
penalty. The Yeltz have now only notched a paltry 5 goals on their league &#xD;
travels - the worst record in the division.</p>
  <p>For the home side Dave Jackson threaded through midfield in the 13th minute but shot well wide. A 19th minute corner from Mark Taylor was easily &#xD;
cleared. With Racing Club Warwick unable to muster a decent scoring &#xD;
opportunity all afternoon, it was left to the visitors to try to break the &#xD;
deadlock, but they were guilty of poor final delivery and missing a host of &#xD;
chances in front of goal. The Yeltz were handed a gift in the 29th minute &#xD;
when Dave Jackson was judged to have tripped Stuart Skidmore in the penalty &#xD;
area - a decision that lead to a huge protest from the home defence. &#xD;
However, even this golden opportunity was wasted when Les Hines hit the &#xD;
spotkick at hand height allowing goalkeeper Matt Tucker to save diving to &#xD;
his left. Taylor then volleyed just wide in the 32nd minute and Tucker held &#xD;
onto an Andy Jones cross at full stretch two minutes before half-time</p>
  <p>Halesowen were well on top in the second period with Matty Hall finding &#xD;
plenty of space to run at the Warwick rearguard.&#xD;
Just after the break Gary Smith won a corner which led to an almighty &#xD;
goalmouth scramble in which Hall and Andy Jones failed to connect from just &#xD;
two yards out and ended with Lee Collins firing high. Neil Smith then &#xD;
misdirected a header in front of goal from a Les Hines cross in the 55th &#xD;
minute and a minute later Jones headed a cross from Taylor against the &#xD;
crossbar from close range with no-one able to take advantage of the &#xD;
inviting rebound. Another loose ball ran across the Warwick goalmouth &#xD;
without finding a finishing touch in the 83rd minute when substitute Alfie &#xD;
Carter won a header from a free-kick. With Jones flashing a 90th minute &#xD;
header over the bar from a corner, the subdued Yeltz fans had to settle for &#xD;
just a single point.</p>
