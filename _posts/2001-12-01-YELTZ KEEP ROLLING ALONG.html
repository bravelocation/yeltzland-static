title: YELTZ KEEP ROLLING ALONG
match: Shepshed 1 Yeltz 2
---

<p>
  <p>Despite everyone feeling a little down on how things have been going, suddenly  <b>the mighty Yeltz have gone back to the  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=01122001">top of the league</a> </b>  and started to pull away from the chasing pack. With Chippenham's game postponed and Clevedon losing, we're top however way you calculate it, and assuming Bloxwich's record is expunged (which I do), then  <b>we're now 4 points clear</b> . Hurrah!</p>
  <p>We lead at half-time through another  <b>Jason Burnham penalty</b> , and after being pegged back to one-all we took all 3 points from a  <b>Neil Smith 20 yard screamer</b> .</p>
  <p>There's finally been some activity on the transfer front.  <b>We've signed forward Lee Ross from Bloxwich</b>  for a supposed four figure sum, and let Kerry Giddings go to Redditch on loan for a while. We've also rumoured to have signed a forward from Crewe on loan.</p>
  <p> <b>Bedworth's</b>  Trophy game was called off today which means our league  <b>game on Tuesday</b>  against them  <b>is off</b>  as well. This means our next game will be against Shepshed again at The Grove on Saturday.</p>

Newbold</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, R. Collins, Spencer, Ross (Hall 80), May, Taylor (Crawford 40), Hines. Subs: G. Smith.</p>

  <p>Halesowen went four points clear at the top of the table, but had to rely on a rare late strike from Neil Smith after threatening to run up a cricket score in the first half.</p>
  <p>Tim Clarke was on hand to make important early saves from Carl Lawrence and Andy Dunn on rare breaks by the home side, but for much of the first half &#xD;
it was one-way traffic towards the Shepshed goal. Ross Collins and Lee Ross &#xD;
both sent volleys high over the goal and Mark Taylor had a free-kick saved &#xD;
by Damion Quailey in the opening spell.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz eventually took the lead when Jason Burnham crashed home his third penalty of the week after Carl Lawrence needlessly handled over his &#xD;
head in the penalty area after 22 minutes. But Halesowen had to be &#xD;
satisfied with a single first half goal as a number of chances continued to &#xD;
go begging. Debut boy Lee Ross blasted wide from a good position and in the &#xD;
28th minute May broke clear and rolled the ball across goal to Mark Taylor, &#xD;
but he struck the post from just 2 yards out. Quailey then produced a &#xD;
splendid save to turn a header from Leroy May for a corner. At the other &#xD;
end Clarke pulled out a good save from a 25-yard free-kick from Kirk &#xD;
Master.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were forced to reorganise in the 40th minute due to injury to Mark Taylor and the change seemed to throw the visitors off balance. &#xD;
Halesowen paid the price for their earlier misses when Shepshed levelled &#xD;
out of the blue in the 56th minute as the dangerous Kirk Master picked up &#xD;
the ball in midfield and ran into the area to hit home into the bottom of &#xD;
the net from 15 yards. For a twenty minute spell Shepshed were transformed &#xD;
and looked the more likely to snatch a winner with Clarke having to make a &#xD;
fine blocking save from Marvin Blake who was clear on goal on the hour.</p>
  <p>May headed onto the top of Shepshed's net from close range with the home defence in chaos before Halesowen were finally claimed the three points &#xD;
that seemed a first half certainty. Ross held up the ball in the area in &#xD;
the 78th minute allowing Neil Smith to smash a 20 yard drive beyond &#xD;
Quailey. With Shepshed's Lawrence being sent off for arguing, Halesowen &#xD;
were content to hold onto the lead although Les Hines went close two &#xD;
minutes from time but was denied by Quailey.</p>
