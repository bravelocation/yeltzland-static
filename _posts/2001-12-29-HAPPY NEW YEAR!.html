---

<p>
  <p>An excellent way to finish what's been a difficult year. Despite being 2-1 down at one point, we came back in style to clinch an easy victory against old rivals Atherstone to maintain our position on  top of the table . Goals from  <b>Bailey, two from Spencer, one from Gary Smith and an own goal</b>  means we go into 2002 in a very strong position to regain our place in the Premier Division.</p>
  <p>Next game is on New Year's Day at The Grove to Evesham, where hopefully we'll continue our excellent run on until the end of the season. Have a very merry New Year!</p>

  <p>Halesowen warmed up a freezing Atherstone afternoon with a festive feast of goals despite going behind early in the game. The win kept up the pressure &#xD;
at the top of the table with the Yeltz reaching 50 points.</p>
  <p>In the first minute Ross Collins won a corner which Dale Belford lost in the blinding sunlight. Just a minute later, the Yeltz made a perfect start &#xD;
when slack defending let Dennis Bailey turn to crack into the top corner &#xD;
from 20 yards. The Adders levelled five minutes later when Emeka Ejiofor &#xD;
split the defence and put Leon Doughty clear to fire between the legs of &#xD;
Tim Clarke. Poor defending gave the home side a 13th minute lead when Lee &#xD;
Middleton squared across the penalty area from the right for Doughty to hit &#xD;
his second goal home from 5 yards, despite the best efforts of Richard &#xD;
Colwell to clear.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen attempting to fight back, Lee Collins headed Taylor's corner &#xD;
over the bar and brother Ross shot at Belford before being stretchered off &#xD;
with a badly gashed ankle in the 21st minute. Ejiofor then hit past the &#xD;
post in the 27th minute and Neil Smith saw his header cleared off the line &#xD;
by Adam Hart a minute later. On the half-hour Gary Smith laid off the ball &#xD;
for Bailey, forcing Belford to make a fine save.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were back on terms with an easy equaliser in the 33rd minute when &#xD;
Gary Smith rolled the ball from the left for Andy Spencer to calmly place &#xD;
home from 12 yards. Spencer returned the compliment on the stroke of half-time by supplying Gary Smith to hit home from close range and regain &#xD;
Halesowen's lead. Tim Clarke was alert to save from Ejiofor in first half &#xD;
stoppage time as the Adders attacks continued to be direct.</p>
  <p>A slip by Neil Smith almost let in Ejiofor after 47 minutes, but Clarke &#xD;
saved the danger. However, the second half started in much quieter fashion &#xD;
from the frantic goal action of the first and it wasn't until 60 minutes &#xD;
that Dennis Bailey had an overhead kick tipped over by Belford. Halesowen &#xD;
then went 4-2 ahead when Adam Hart hit the ball into his own net when &#xD;
attempting to clear Colwell's right wing cross on 66 minutes. Bailey hit &#xD;
the bar two minutes from time from just 8 yards out after Hines had crossed &#xD;
from the left following good play by Gary Smith. In the final minute Andy &#xD;
Spencer burst forward to crack Halesowen's fifth goal into the bottom &#xD;
corner from 20 yards.</p>
