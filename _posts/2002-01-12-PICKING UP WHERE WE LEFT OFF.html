  <p>Halesowen hit three goals in the final half-hour to break the Steelmen's resistance and eventually notch a comfortable victory.</p>
  <p>Spencer should have opened the scoring with the first attack in the 2nd &#xD;
minute when a flowing move ended with Leroy May finding Spencer unmarked &#xD;
eight yards out but, after turning, his shot dribbled agonisingly wide. The &#xD;
influential Mark Taylor then put May free but his effort was cleared for a &#xD;
corner. Bilston were much changed from the team the Yeltz played in Nove  &#xD;
mber and started on the back-foot although the ageing Charlie Blakemore saw &#xD;
his 8th minute shot blocked.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to apply the first half pressure and in the 17th minute &#xD;
Stuart Skidmore had a shot cleared off the line by Quentin Townsend after &#xD;
Dennis Bailey had weaved through the Bilston defence. Taylor then lofted a &#xD;
free-kick from the edge of the area just high and Spencer volleyed wide &#xD;
when Bailey had headed down. After 32 minutes Bailey then laid off a long &#xD;
goalkick from Tim Clarke to Spencer again but the Bilston defence blocked &#xD;
as he charged towards goal. A minute later Bailey headed a Taylor corner &#xD;
just wide and 8 minutes before the break Jason Burnham fired in a 20 yard &#xD;
shot which was well held by goalkeeper Simon Bryan. Man of the match Lee &#xD;
Collins received lengthy treatment to a cut head just before the interval &#xD;
after being caught by Lee Bullimore.</p>
  <p>An exciting second half started with Spencer just off target again with a &#xD;
header after both Bailey and May had headed on. The visitors then missed a &#xD;
golden opportunity to snatch the lead in the 51st minute when Clarke failed &#xD;
to gather a Danny Coates corner, but Stuart Grosvenor headed over from just &#xD;
3 yards out when unmarked.</p>
  <p>At the Shed End, Les Hines fired a 20-yard shot onto the top of the net and &#xD;
a delightful 55th minute cross from Taylor was met with a Bailey header, &#xD;
but the ball struck the post and rebounded into safety. Bilston then missed &#xD;
another great chance when Lee Bullimore could only glance a free header &#xD;
wide from another Coates cross.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally broke through on the hour when Taylor played the ball out &#xD;
to Hines on the left wing and his cross was met with a firm downwards &#xD;
header by SPENCER rushing into the box to record his 4th goal in three &#xD;
games. Just two minutes later Hines was brought down in the area by Steve &#xD;
Ball, and after Hines received treatment, BURNHAM stepped up to stroke the &#xD;
penalty home in the 64th minute.</p>
  <p>Hard working Bilston never looked likely to stage a recovery although &#xD;
substitute Greg Walters saw a shot drift wide after 73 minutes. With &#xD;
Halesowen seeking more goals, a corner from Hines after 76 minutes saw the &#xD;
ball cleared off the line in a goalmouth scramble. A minute from time, &#xD;
Halesowen hit a third goal in a fine move started in midfield by Taylor &#xD;
setting Hines free on the left to deliver an inch-perfect cross for BAILEY &#xD;
to tap home.</p>
