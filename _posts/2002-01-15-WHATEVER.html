<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz were beaten 3-0 by a surprisingly experienced Blues side in a match used by Brendan to give a few players a run out who haven't been regulars recently. It's always nice to win, but as I always say these Senior Cups are completely inconsequential so it doesn't matter one bit at all. Full details in the  match reports .</p>
  <p>We're back in league action with a  <b>trip down to Gloucester on Saturday</b>  where we've had some "interesting" visits before.</p>

  <p>Halesowen bowed out of the Birmingham Senior Cup and were well beaten by a strong Blues line-up. Craig Fagan set Birmingham on the road to victory by glancing home a left &#xD;
wing cross from Bryan Hughes in the 9th minute. Home youngster Andy Spencer &#xD;
brought a 20th minute save out of Nico Vaesan, but it was Halesowen &#xD;
goalkeeper Tim Clarke who was kept on his toes for most of the evening. &#xD;
Clarke saved a looping header from Jerry Gill in the 22nd minute before &#xD;
tipping over a 20-yard effort from Bryan Hughes on the half-hour.</p>
  <p>Lee Ross hit a speculative shot wide from a Clarke clearance after 40 &#xD;
minutes for the Yeltz, but the lively Andy Johnson kept the Halesowen &#xD;
defence busy with John Newall making an impressive home debut. Johnson &#xD;
rounded Clarke early in the second half but the home defence cleared. &#xD;
Clarke then smothered a 50th minute shot from McCarthy and saved from Andy &#xD;
Johnson after he played a clever pass with Hughes a minute later.</p>
  <p>Fagan struck again for the visitors on the hour by blasting past Clarke &#xD;
after being set up by McCarthy. A third goal followed in the 66th minute &#xD;
when McCarthy found space in the penalty area to beat Clarke from 10-yards &#xD;
out.</p>
