  <p>The whole country's been hit by some awful weather over the last few days, so it was no surprise that the game against Cirencester was called off early Saturday morning because of a waterlogged pitch. As all the other games were off as well, obviously there's been no effect to the table.</p>
  <p>Everyone was saddened by hearing of the death of Brendan's father this week. He's had to go to Jamaica for a couple of weeks to sort things out leaving team affairs in the hands of Mark Taylor, Neil Smith and Tim Clarke.</p>
  <p>Weather permitting, we've got Evesham at home on Tuesday in the Worcester Senior Cup replay, before a game of real consequence at home to  <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/theseagulls/">Weston</a>  in a very important promotion game. Come on!</p>
