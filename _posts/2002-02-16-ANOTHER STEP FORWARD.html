title: ANOTHER STEP FORWARD
match: Evesham 0 Yeltz 3

<p>
  <p>It just gets better and better. A comfortable 3-0 victory against Evesham coupled with both Weston and Solihull dropping points means we're even further ahead in the  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=16022002">promotion race</a> .</p>
  <p>An early goal from  <b>Neil Smith</b>  settled everyone's nerves, and then another before half-time from  <b>Leroy</b>  just about clinched it the way our defence is playing. A third from  <b>Andy Spencer</b>  finished off an easy victory against one of the better teams in the league.</p>
  <p>There's been discussions about setting up an  <b>Official Supporters Club</b>  recently. Read  <a href="/travel/supportersclub.asp">Kev Crook's letter</a>  for more information on a subject which has already led to some interesting debates.</p>
  <p>Tuesday brings Cirencester to The Grove for the first home league game for ages, and then we host Moor Green in the Worcester Senior Cup semi-final on Saturday.</p>
