<p>
  <p>It was closer than might have been expected, but all that matters is that it's yet another win and another step closer to promotion. A first half goal from the excellent  <b>Andy Spencer</b>  has taken us  <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=19022002">15 points clear</a>  of 3rd place Weston</b>  - although they have 2 games in hand - and 6 points clear of Chippenham in second place.</p>
  <p>There's been discussions about setting up an  <b>Official Supporters Club</b>  recently. Read  <a href="/travel/supportersclub.asp">Kev Crook's letter</a>  for more information on a subject which has already led to some interesting debates.</p>
  <p>The strange way the fixture list works out this year means we host  <b>Moor Green in the Worcester Senior Cup semi-final on Saturday</b>  in an interesting distraction from important matters.</p>
