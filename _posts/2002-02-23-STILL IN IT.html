match: WSC  Yeltz 1 Moor Green 1

<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz are still in the all important Worcester Senior Cup after a 1-1 draw against Moor Green at The Grove. An excellent strike from  <b>Andy Jones</b>  was cancelled out by a second half equaliser in a match played in difficult conditions. Replay details as soon as I hear.</p>
  <p>Elsewhere,  <b>Chippenham lost at home to Gresley</b> , Solihull stuffed Bilston 6-0 and Weston's game was called off. This has consolidated our lead at  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=23022002">the top of the table</a>  and gives both Solihull and Weston a chance of catching Chips and Ham if they win their games in hand.</p>
  <p>There's a few photos been sent in recently - thanks to DJ and Peter Blanchflower - that you might find of interest: action shots of the  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=16022002#photos">Evesham game</a>  and  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=23022002#photos">Brendan winning Manager of the Month</a> .</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us to  <b>Solihull</b>  in what's potentially our hardest game left. A victory for us would make it very difficult for Solihull to catch us, so it's an important game. Come on!</p>
