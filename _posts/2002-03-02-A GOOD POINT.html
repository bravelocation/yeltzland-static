title: A GOOD POINT
match: Solihull 1 Yeltz 1
---

<p>
  <p>Although we've got used to winning our league games recently, the mighty Yeltz gained a very useful point away to one of their few promotion rivals. A first half goal from  <b>Leroy</b>  took us into the lead, but Solihull came back in the second half to get a draw in a match they really had to win.</p>
  <p>Chippenham had an easy victory against Warwick and Weston didn't have a game, so we're still  top of the table  and in an excellent position. Look out for the results of Weston at Cinderford and Solihull against Swindon on Tuesday.</p>
  <p>Our next game is on Saturday when we visit glamorous Bedworth in a game in which I'd hope we can get back to winning ways.</p>

  <p>Although Halesowen's impressive run of away wins finally ended, the point was important to prevent one of the possible promotion challengers from making any headway on Halesowen's top spot.</p>
  <p>In a slow Yeltz opening on a heavily sanded pitch, Mark Taylor was bundled over in the box after 9 minutes but referee Whitestone waved play on and Lee Collins then nodded a 16th minute free-kick from Les Hines just wide. Solihull's hot-shot striker Derek Hall turned in the penalty area a minute later but could only shoot weakly at Tim Clarke. After the cautious start, it was Solihull's Derek Hall who went close by blasting into the side-netting on 35 minutes from the left edge of the box.</p>
  <p>Halesowen enjoyed a fine spell of play in the ten minutes before half-time and should have taken the lead when Leroy May picked up a rebound and fed Mark Taylor who in turn set up Les Hines but he blasted wide from a good position. The lead finally arrived in the 39th minute when Denis Bailey forced a right wing corner. The corner kick fell to May two yards out with his back to goal and he cheekily back-heeled the ball into the net off the legs of Solihull's Craig Dutton. Jason Burnham's then saw a low shot saved by Brendan Murphy and at the other end Tim Clarke saved well from Andy Lovelock.</p>
  <p>Solihull deservedly equalised in the 63rd minute when a flowing move ended with Manual Pereira squaring for Chris Smith to fire into the bottom corner from 20 yards out with Clarke only able to watch. The league leaders survived a scare six minutes later when a dangerous right-wing cross found two forwards free in the box but Clarke made a fingertip save from Derek Hall's weak effort and the excellent Richard Colwell completed the clearance off the goal-line. Having lost Les Hines and Andy Spencer during the game through injury, the Yeltz appeared slightly heavy-legged as they came under a period of Solihull pressure.</p>
  <p>However, in and end-to-end finish of open play, substitute Matty Hall couldn't convert May's flick-on past Murphy, Andy Jones fired high when well placed in the 80th minute and a Lee Collins header fell just wide. For Solihull, Chris Smith shot high from the edge of the area after 85 minutes and Clarke produced a fine reflex save from a fierce 20-yard shot by Simon Hollis with two minutes remaining.</p>
  <p>A last minute corner for the Yeltz caused confusion for the Boro' defence but Lee Collins could only shoot into the arms of Murphy.</p>
