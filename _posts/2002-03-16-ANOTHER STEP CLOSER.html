title: ANOTHER STEP CLOSER
match: Yeltz 5 Swindon Supermarine 1

<p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz continued their march back to the Premier Division with an easy 5-1 victory over bottom placed Swindon Supermarine. Two first half goals from Les Hines and one from Andy Spencer set us on our way, and further goals from Leroy and a JB penalty kept us on  despite letting in a late Swindon penalty.

  <p>In the other crucial promotion games, Chippenham drew 1-1 with Weston and Solihull won 4-0 against Gloucester. All this means is we now need a maximum of just 17 points to clinch promotion, and 19 points to become champions. I've added a handy reminder on the right of the home page to add to the excitement.</p>
  <p>Tuesday brings Weston to The Grove in a game which could just about clinch promotion for us. We still haven't won against any of the top teams this season so let's hope that changes and we can enjoy a comfortable end of season run in. Come on!</p>
  <p>As you can hopefully see I've tarted the site up a little - I hope you like it.</p>

  <p>Brendan Philips asked his players to remain totally focussed and received&#xD;
the perfect response in a game some observers felt could be a potential&#xD;
"banana skin". However, bottom side Swindon were sunk by a five-star&#xD;
performance with five goals in a 35-minute spell.</p>
  <p>Andy Spencer scuffed a 13th minute shot when Leroy May flicked on, but in a&#xD;
quiet opening Halesowen showed patience as relegation threatened Swindon&#xD;
packed their defence. The breakthrough came after 21 minutes when May was&#xD;
fouled on the edge of the penalty area and Les Hines fired a low free-kick&#xD;
directly past the wall and beyond goalkeeper Liam Bull. As Swindon's defence&#xD;
panicked Stuart Skidmore went close from a May flick on in the 23rd minute&#xD;
and the second goal soon followed three minutes later. In a crowded&#xD;
goalmouth Dennis Bailey saw his header cleared off the line from a corner&#xD;
but as Lee Collins turned the ball back in, Andy Spencer headed into the&#xD;
unprotected net from close range. On the half-hour Bailey had a shot turned&#xD;
away for a corner and then hit the side-netting from Mark Taylor's corner&#xD;
kick with the ball resembling a pin-ball in the Swindon area. Spencer&#xD;
crossed just high for May in the 36th minute and from the follow-up Bailey's&#xD;
shot was yet again blocked. Swindon earned their first corner of the game in&#xD;
the 44th minute but it was the Yeltz who went 3-0 ahead on the stroke of&#xD;
half-time when Swindon failed to clear a Skidmore cross and Hines had the&#xD;
easy task of heading into the unguarded net.</p>
  <p>The relentless pressure continued at the start of the second half with Mark&#xD;
Taylor skimming the bar in the 46th minute before the fourth goal arrived&#xD;
after 53 minutes. It was Supermarine's inability to defend against set&#xD;
pieces that was their undoing again when they failed to clear another corner&#xD;
from Hines and May was on hand to nod home from a couple of yards out. With&#xD;
Swindon all at sea, goalkeeper Bull pulled down Spencer as he was rounding&#xD;
him and about to shoot and Jason Burnham banged home the resulting penalty&#xD;
to increase the lead on 58 minutes. Tim Clarke was at last in action after&#xD;
80 minutes when he dived to save Dominic Dunton's 25 yard shot but Burnham&#xD;
then almost added to his tally but Bull just gathered the ball as he was&#xD;
being rounded.</p>
  <p>Swindon finally gained a goal when referee Flannagan awarded a penalty&#xD;
against Lee Collins who was retrieving a ball from Adam Giles that was&#xD;
trapped between his legs. Tom Jones showed it's not unusual for Swindon to&#xD;
score by firing home the penalty and sent Swindon back to the green, green&#xD;
grass of home with some consolation. In the final minute Swindon survived&#xD;
another goalmouth scramble from a corner with May cracking the crossbar.</p>
