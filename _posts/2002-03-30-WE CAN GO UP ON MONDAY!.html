match: Bilston 1 Yeltz 2

<root>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz are  <b>just one win away from returning to the Premier Division</b>  after a hard fought and slightly nervous win at Bilston.</p>
  <p>We started well against a Bilston side who at least tried to play a passing game on a dry and bumpy pitch. Their keeper looked about 5 foot tall so we weren't too surprised when  <b>Leroy</b>  jumped above him to head in the first. We missed a few good chances in the rest of the first half, though  <b>Mark Taylor</b>  scored his first for The Yeltz from the edge of box and it looked all over.</p>
  <p>However in the second half Bilston continued to try and play, and understandably we were happy to settle with what we'd got. When they scored half way through the second half everyone got very nervous, and despite Bilston having a man sent off for a bad tackle on Les (who later hobbled off), we were very relieved when the final whistle went.</p>
  <p>So on to Monday, and  <b>a huge game at home to Solihull Borough</b>  (kickoff 7.45pm). The permutations are this:</p>
  <p>We think the other games are afternoon kickoffs, so we should know what we need to do by the time we play. Whatever the outcome,  <b>get all your mates down The Grove and let's make Monday a night to remember</b> . Even I'm going to be there, but I'll try and update at least part of the site as soon as I can (look for the Stop Press on thetop right of the home page)</p>
