<p>
  <p>We're still waiting to be mathematically certain of going up as Champions after a second successive draw at home to Gloucester. It would have been nice to clinch it at The Grove, but we now  <b>only need a point</b>  from the last two games assuming Chippenham win their last game. Chippenham themselves have now confirmed promotion, and beat Cirencester 3-1 on Thursday.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us to  <b>Mangotsfield for the last away game of the season</b>  and the usual fancy dress shenanigans. It should be an excellent day out to try and finish this successful season off in style.</p>
  <p>There's a new section of the site that I'm very excited about - the  <b> Yeltz Hall of Fame </b> . It's your chance to recognise players, managers or indeed anyone who has made an outstanding contribution to Halesowen Town. Please check it out.</p>

  <p>Halesowen kept their expectant fans waiting to clinch the title after being held to a goal-less draw by gallant Gloucester City. With Chippenham winning at Atherstone, the game left the Yeltz still requiring a further point to be mathematically certain of being crowned as champions.</p>
  <p>Ball control was difficult on a rock-hard surface and shots flew high over the bar all afternoon in a game dominated by the Yeltz with Gloucester hardly mustering a shot on target all afternoon. Alex Cowley turned and fired wide after four minutes and Andy Spencer hit the cross-bar four minutes later when Leroy May headed on a long throw-in from Jason Burnham. Spencer crashed the ball high again in the 33rd minute and just before half-time Cowley delivered dangerously from the right for visiting defender Neil Griffiths to nudge the ball past his own post for a corner.</p>
  <p>Gloucester's best opportunity came in the 50th minute when young on-loan goalkeeper Clint Davies mis-kicked a clearance straight to Luke Prince but central defender Lee Collins made a great saving tackle in front of an empty net. Les Hines and Cowley fired further shots well over the bar before the Tigers' goalkeeper Matt Bath made a fine blocking save from a May header after 80 minutes with Andy Jones and Gary Smith ready to pounce. With growing frustration, Halesowen mounted a final frantic assault on the Gloucester goal but could not break the deadlock to collect the Western Division trophy.</p>
