<root>
  <p>A few bits of news in this awful time of the year. First the  <b>ticket prices have been announced</b> :</p>
  <p>Extra Â£10.00 for reserved season ticket seat in stand.</p>
  <p>Current season ticket holders - If you renew your ticket you get all friendlies FREE due to the missed Bloxwich home fixture last season. New season ticket holders get W.B.A friendly free. Season tickets go on sale - At the ground on Saturday 6th and 13th July 9:30am-12:00; In The Yeltz Bar on Tuesday 16th July 9-10pm; Thursday 18th July 8-10pm.</p>
  <p>Details of  <b>the pre-season friendlies</b>  are coming through. The first one is against the  <b>Albion</b>  at The Grove on July 20th (you can get tickets at the same time as your season ticket), plus games against  <b>Walsall and Boston</b>  at home and  <b>AP Leamington, Willenhall and Stourport</b>  away.</p>
  <p>Still waiting for any confirmed transfer news, but nothing will happen soon as most players contracts are up on June 1st. Rumours of talks with Snapper, Pie-arce and Elmes still persist, but we'll just have to wait and see.</p>
  <p>There's a new vote out, and don't forget to vote in the  <a href="/haveyoursay/halloffame/">Yeltz Hall of Fame</a>  as votes close at the end of May.</p>
