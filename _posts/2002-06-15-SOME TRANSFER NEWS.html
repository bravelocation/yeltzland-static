<p>
  <p>I expect you've been a bit distracted by the World Cup like me, but there's been a few bits of news of the Mighty Yeltz.</p>
  <p>On the transfer front, we've signed old favourite  <b>Rob Elmes</b> , and also his ex-Hereford teammate  <b>Jimmy Quiggin</b>  and attacking midfielder. A couple of good additions to the squad I would say. We won't be getting back ther other old boys Snapper and Piearce as they've signed for Worcester and Hednesford respectively. We're also looking to sign former Wolves reserve striker  <b>Richard Leadbetter</b>  if he can prove his fitness.</p>
  <p>The voting for the  <a href="/haveyoursay/halloffame/"&gt;Yeltz Hall of Fame</a>  has now closed, so you can see who's made it into the list of all time greats.</p>
  <p>The full list of friendlies (I think!) is now available on the  <a href="/anorak/results.asp?season=2002"&gt;fixtures page</a> , with the first game on July 16th at the Harriers. Also, Mr. Cooper has produced a lovely  <a href="/posters/July2002.pdf"&gt;poster</a>  for you to download, print out and put in your window to get all those waverers to get down The Grove this season. Come on!</p>
