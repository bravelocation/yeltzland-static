  <p>With the World Cup over we can now concentrate on what's a mercifully short wait until the new season. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>
    The  is now out, and I've uploaded all of the DMPL fixtures on to the site for your perusal. The season kicks off on August 17 at The Grove against Welling and finishes on May 3 at home to Chippenham - the last away game being a reasonable trip to Folkestone. The FA Trophy draw has also been made, and we're at home to Bath in the 1st Round.

  <p>No additional player news as yet, other than we're back in training with the first friendly against the Harriers next week (July 16th). I'm getting a little excited already.</p>
