<p>
  <p>And we're off again. A low key start at our, well I don't know what to call them...partner? ... subsiduary? ... anyway Halesowen Harriers and a nice 2-0 victory with second half goals from  <b>Les Hines</b>  and  <b>Rob Elmes</b> .</p>
  <p>There was the usual mix of regulars and trialists - full details in  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=16072002">DJ's match report</a>  - but the big news is that old favorite  <b>Sean Flynn</b>  turned out in the second half. I'm not certain what the situation with Flynnie making it a lengthy return, but I think everyone would be very excited if he did.</p>
  <p>Next fixture is the annual extravaganza down The Grove against the  <b>Albion on Saturday</b> . There's all sorts of events going on around the game so it should be, as they say, a fun day out for all the family.</p>

  <p>Halesowen Town fielded two teams and included their former favourite and ex-Baggies midfield maestro Sean Flynn in their second-half line up. The friendly cemented the recently announced partnership between the two Halesowen clubs with the higher league Yeltz coming out on top.</p>
  <p>Richard Adams rattled the post with a 20-yard drive for Town in the 14th minute and Tim Clarke collected a Richard Perry shot at the other end two minutes later. With the Harriers giving a good account of themselves Clint Hughes made a solo run before shooting wide on 37 minutes.</p>
  <p>Dr Martens Premier Halesowen Town finally went ahead two minutes into the second half with Les Hines touching the ball home from a Rob Elmes flick-on. The lead was extended on the hour when Flynn chipped into the box and although Neil Turner saved Jason Ashby's shot, Elmes headed home the ball on the goal-line. Turner then did well to cut out a 65th minute cross from Hines before Ashby curled a 70th minute effort just wide. The Harriers goalkeeper went on to make a string of saves from Andy Spencer, Elmes and Ashby in an 80th minute goalmouth scramble with the Yeltz well on top.</p>
