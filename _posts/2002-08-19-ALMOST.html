  <p>Halesowen twice battled back from behind in an excellent second-half display but still &#xD;
			left Keys Park empty-handed due to defensive frailty.</p>
  <p>The home side had the better of the first half with Derek Rae hitting a &#xD;
			rebound over the bar after 6 minutes but Halesowen's Richard Leadbeater &#xD;
			flashed a header wide of the post from a Les Hines corner a minute later. &#xD;
			Mark Jones turned Jason Burnham in the 9th minute and drove wide from 12 yards &#xD;
			before hitting inches high from 20 yards in the 14th minute. &#xD;
			Shaun Wray then drove wide from 20 yards as the home side sought an opener.</p>
  <p>Lee Collins headed a Jason Burnham free-kick just wide of the post &#xD;
			after 22 minutes and 4 minutes later Collins made a timely tackle on the &#xD;
			edge of his own box from the advancing Wray.</p>
  <p>
    Hednesford took the lead in the 41st minute when Neil Smith brought down &#xD;
			Wray in the box and  hit the penalty into the top left corner of the net. Leadbeater almost equalised on the stroke of half-time &#xD;

    Halesowen started brightly at the start of the second period and gradually took control of the game. &#xD;
			Good work from Andy Spencer set up Richard Colwell after 47 minutes but &#xD;
			there was no-one on the end of his dangerous cross. The Yeltz deservedly &#xD;
			equalised in the 58th minute with a splendid goal on the break. &#xD;
			Tim Clarke collected a corner and sent a long kick out to Spencer &#xD;
			down the left who then fed Les Hines and his left-wing cross was &#xD;
			sidefooted home on the volley at the far post by . &#xD;
			Quiggin almost scored a second in the 67th minute when set free but he &#xD;
			hit wide of Mark Gayle's post.

    A minute later Halesowen paid the price when Hednesford re-gained the &#xD;
			lead out of the blue. A Collins clearance could only find Wray and his &#xD;
			right-wing cross was headed home beyond the grasp of Clarke from 15 yards &#xD;
			by the unmarked . &#xD;
			However, Halesowen equalised for a second time in the 75th minute when a &#xD;
			Burnham cross was headed against the post by Elmes and  was &#xD;
			on hand to turn in the rebound from 5 yards out.
    
      <b>MARK JONES</b>

  <p>Substitute Stuart Airdrie then went on a great run from &#xD;
			his own half ending with Clarke making a fine save from his&#xD;
			20 yard shot and in the &#xD;
			80th minute Clarke saved a quickly taken free-kick from Carl Adams.</p>
  <p>
    Three minutes from time Hednesford grabbed the winner when Lucas hit &#xD;
			a long free-kick into the Halesowen area. Clarke called for the ball, &#xD;
			but  nipped in before Clarke collected to head into an &#xD;
			empty net. A minute from time Hines curled in a free-kick from the &#xD;
			edge of the box but goalkeeper Gayle managed to punch the ball clear from &#xD;
			under his crossbar.
