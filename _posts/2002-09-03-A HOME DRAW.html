title: A HOME DRAW
match: Yeltz 0 Tamworth 0
---

<p>
  <p>For the third game in succession at The Grove, the mighty Yeltz earned just a single point, this time against last season's runner-up Tamworth.</p>
  <p>
    The draw leaves us in a disappointing  after the first six games and still without a win. Let's not get too downhearted though - we're not playing too badly at all, and hopefully just need a win to kickstart the season.

  <p>Although Halesowen remain without a win and produced few chances they &#xD;
remain unbeaten at home and will be satisfied with a point against &#xD;
their much fancied rivals.</p>
  <p>An early 3rd minute cross from Jimmy Quiggin was smothered by a &#xD;
combination of Simon Marsh and goalkeeper &#xD;
Darren Acton while Mark Sale turned and drove just wide in the 12th minute at &#xD;
the other end for the visitors.</p>
  <p>Jason Ashby almost nipped in to take advantage of Paul Hatton's header back &#xD;
to Acton in the 17th minute before man-of-the-match Tim Clarke came into his &#xD;
own. Clarke made a full length diving save from Fraser McHugh's 18th minute &#xD;
drive from 25 yards and then pulled out a tremendous double save in the &#xD;
38th minute. The menacing Tony Hemmings beat two defenders on the left to &#xD;
hit a fierce drive which Clarke beat down with Sale heading the rebound &#xD;
into Clarke's arms. Two minutes later McHugh put the ball back into the area &#xD;
from a corner to find Sale completely unmarked but he headed straight at &#xD;
Clarke again.</p>
  <p>A minute before half-time Richard Colwell played a great ball out of &#xD;
defence to Jason Ashby but the striker snatched at his shot in the &#xD;
penalty area.</p>
  <p>Tamworth remained on top in the second-half without finding the &#xD;
vital final touch and it was Clarke who went on to beat away McHugh's &#xD;
55th minute drive from 20 yards before Hemmings hit the &#xD;
side-netting when unmarked on the left on the hour. &#xD;
Five minutes later Mark Turner flashed a header wide from Scott &#xD;
Rickards cross. Ten minutes from full-time Halesowen substitute Richard &#xD;
Leadbeater cut in from the right but his shot was blocked by Turner.</p>
