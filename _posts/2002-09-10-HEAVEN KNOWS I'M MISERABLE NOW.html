match: Bath 3 Yeltz 0

<p>
  <p>After the promise of Saturday, the mighty Yeltz slipped into the  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=10092002">bottom four</a>  with a dismal 3-0 defeat away to  <a href="http://www.bathcityfc.com/">Bath City</a> .</p>
  <p>It was a pretty even first half, but unfortunately after Lee Collins went off injured they took the lead just before the break with the usual goal from a set piece. The second half was very depressing as they scored twice more, we had Holmes sent off and didn't make their keeper make a single save I can remember.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we travel to  <a href="http://www.thelilywhites.com/">Cambridge</a> . It's my birthday, so I'm expecting a nice present of a win - or at least for me to see a Halesowen goal this season. Please.</p>
