<p>
  <p>Another home game, another draw and that's now four 0-0 games out of five at The Grove - I can hear the grumbling from 200 miles away. We've moved up to a glorious  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=17092002">17th in the table</a>  so it's not too disastrous. More about the game in the  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=17092002">match reports</a> .</p>
  <p>Some movement on the transfer front this week.  <b>We've signed Kirk Master</b>  from Shepshed, who've we've been after for a while, and it appears Andy Jones has gone to Redditch on loan. I'm sure you'd all like to extend a warm welcome to Kirk, and hope he'll be a huge success for us!</p>
  <p>We've got a decent draw in the  <b>FA Cup</b>  2nd Qualifying Round,  <b>away to Sutton Coldfield</b> . The winners get Â£7500 in prize money so it's very important we get through as many rounds as we can, not only for the glory of the Cup. It's how football is today I guess (showing my age now).</p>
  <p>On Saturday we welcome  <a href="http://www.crawley-town-fc.co.uk/">Crawley</a>  to The Grove in another important league game. They've been going pretty well so far this season, so it ain't gonna be easy (again).</p>

  <p>Halesowen recorded their fourth nil-nil home draw in five home games in an even contest played at a lightning pace. On the plus side the Yeltz remain unbeaten at home, having conceded only one goal.</p>
  <p>Early on John Newall sent in a rasping shot and then headed into the arms of Collis in the 8th minute. Rob Elmes met a 14th minute Richard Colwell cross but he failed to keep his header down.</p>
  <p>For Tiverton Anthony Lynch hit a 15-yard shot wide under challenge by Jason Burnham in the 23rd minute. Andy Spencer then made a great 24th minute run into the area but his cross bobbled just as Lee Collins was about to shoot before Richard Leadbeater struck the side-netting from close range from Colwell's cross. Jimmy Quiggin broke down the middle and fed Leadbeater on the left in the 42nd minute but his cross to Elmes was side-footed past the post from 3 yards out. A minute before half-time Tiverton centre-forward Phil Everett stooped to head onto the far post with the home defence exposed.</p>
  <p>In the second half a Les Hines free-kick was headed on by Newall to Lee Collins but his header was gathered low down by Collis after 58 minutes. At the other end Nathan Rudge headed to Lynch but Clarke extended his hand to make a reflex save on the hour. A dangerous 66th minute cross from the left by Hines found Leadbeater but he failed to add a strong enough touch and the ball went wide. Spencer then saw his 71st minute shot deflected for a corner.</p>
  <p>Clarke helped to keep the scores level when he saved a 20-yard shot low down from Kevin Nancekivell in the 76th minute and a minute later a slip by Neil Smith let in Everett but Clarke made a great save with Lynch hitting the rebound over the bar. New signing Kirk Master appeared for the final 20 minutes and showed promise with some neat touches.</p>
  <p>A 15-yard strike by Tiverton substitute Richard Pears was ruled out for offside six minutes from time.</p>
