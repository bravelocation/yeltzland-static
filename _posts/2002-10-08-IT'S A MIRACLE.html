---

<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz gained a crucial three points tonight, with two goals in the last three minutes against bottom placed Ilkeston.</p>
  <p>After going behind in the first half, it was looking pretty desparate until Rob Elmes equalised in the 88th minute, and then Marky Taylor got a winner in injury time for our first victory at The Grove all season. More details as soon as I get them.</p>
  <p>
    We're still , but are still in touch with most of the bottom half - we're only 5 points behind 11th placed Newport.
