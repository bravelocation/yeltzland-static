title: IT'S A MIRACLE
match: Yeltz 2 Ilkeston 1
---

<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz gained a crucial three points tonight, with two goals in the last three minutes against bottom placed Ilkeston.</p>
  <p>After going behind in the first half, it was looking pretty desparate until Rob Elmes equalised in the 88th minute, and then Marky Taylor got a winner in injury time for our first victory at The Grove all season. More details as soon as I get them.</p>
  <p>We're still  20th in the table , but are still in touch with most of the bottom half - we're only 5 points behind 11th placed Newport.</p>
  <p>There's a welcome break from league football on Saturday with an important FA Cup tie at  <a href="http://www.moorgreenfc.co.uk/">Moor Green</a>  - as well as the glory there's the prize money we'll gain if we get through. Let's have it!</p>
