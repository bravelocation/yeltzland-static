title: DOWN AND OUT
match: FAC  Moor Green 3 Yeltz 1

  <p>Despite taking an early lead through Jason Ashby, the Yeltz crashed out of the FA Cup in a hotly disputed game at Moor Green.</p>
  <p>According to  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/">what you lot are saying</a>  the ref was abysmal, giving them two dubious penalties, us hundreds of bookings and sending Lee Collins off for nothing. Not a good day, and a real downer after the excitement of Tuesday. I'm sure there will be loads more discussion on  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/">YeltzTalk</a>  about the game.</p>
  <p>Of course losing in the Cup meant we missed out on the substantial prize money that's on offer for winners of each round. This makes even more relevant last week's  <a href="/news/pressrelease20021011.asp">press release from the club</a>  about how they would like to restructure the board to promote external investment.</p>
  <p>Tuesday takes us back to Stourport Swifts in the Worcester Senior Cup, before Saturday's long trip down to  <a href="http://www.forumco.com/weymouthfc/default.asp">Weymouth</a>  in the league.</p>
