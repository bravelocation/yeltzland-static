  <p>Heavy rain down South meant we kept our good run going by getting the game called off. I think it would have been a good time to play them as they're still involved in the FA Cup which might have distracted them, whereas now we'll have a long midweek trip.</p>
  <p>It looks like we've signed Phil Trainor, a talented young midfielder who's previously played for Crewe. Sounds like a good addition to the squad, and Brendan's track record recently has been outstanding.</p>

    Tuesday brings  to The Grove in the League Cup. Apologies to all Fantasy Island players over the slight confusion over the fixture date :-(
