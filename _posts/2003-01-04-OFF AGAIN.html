<p>
  <p>Unsurprisingly following the recent awful weather, today's game at Dover was called off due to a waterlogged pitch. A lovely midweek trip awaits later in the year. Unfortunately, with Cambridge winning we've now slipped into the  bottom four  :-(</p>
  <p>This week we've got a Birmingham Senior Cup tie against Birmingham City at The Grove on Tuesday, before a very interesting FA Trophy 3rd Round tie away to Unibond Division One side  <a href="http://www.alfretontownfc.com/">Alfreton Town</a>  next Saturday.</p>
  <p>They're well clear at the top of their league, have scored loads of goals and beat Stafford Rangers in the last round so it's going to be a difficult tie. However, another form line shows they only beat Spennymoor 2-1 and are in a weaker league than ourselves, so it should be a very good game.</p>
  <p>Let's hope our excellent Cup form continues - and the weather clears up a bit.</p>
