  <p>I'm feeling very deprived at the moment, with our third game on the trot being called off because of the bad weather. Very frustrating for everyone.</p>
  <p>
    On Saturday - weather permitting of course - we've got a very interesting FA Trophy 3rd Round tie away to Unibond Division One side  next Saturday.
    
  </p>
  <p>They're well clear at the top of their league, have scored loads of goals and beat Stafford Rangers in the last round so it's going to be a difficult tie. However, another form line shows they only beat Spennymoor 2-1 and are in a weaker league than ourselves, so it should be a very good game.</p>
  <p>Let's hope our excellent Cup form continues - and the weather clears up a bit.</p>
