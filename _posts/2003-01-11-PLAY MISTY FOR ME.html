  <p>The promising Trophy run ended in disappointing fashion with the Yeltz being outplayed in the North Derbyshire mud. The game only went ahead with intensive morning pitch work - including the use of industrial heaters - but it was the Yeltz who blew hot and cold during a game in which they conceded too much play in midfield.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were first to show with Richard Colwell clipping a shot straight at goalkeeper Ross Turner after a poor 1st minute clearance by Lee Hobson. Ross Collins then blasted wide from Andy Spencer's 5th minute cross.</p>
  <p>However, the runaway leaders of the Unibond Division One had already clocked up an unbeaten sequence of 23 games and clearly fancied their chances against their higher league opposition as they took charge of the game. Jamie Robshaw worked down the right to earn a 17th minute corner taken by Chris Bettney with ex-Sheffield United star Carl Bradshaw seeing his shot cleared off the line. Alfreton's fourth corner in the 21st minute was lost by Tim Clarke in a crowded goal-mouth, but Hobson smashed the loose ball way over the bar and into the adjacent gardens. Ryan France then struck the base of the post in the 33rd minute and when the ball was crossed back into the area Bradshaw nodded inches wide. Three minutes before half-time Halesowen ventured up-field with Jason Ashby's cross from the left deflected for a corner, but Ross Collins saw his shot blocked by a packed defence.</p>
  <p>The travelling faithful had the luxurious choice of 600 seats behind the goal for the second half - but as no-one had thought to build a stand first, the seating was open to the elements.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued on the defensive in the second period and had a 53rd minute let-off when Clarke was beaten to the ball by Robshaw but the striker's shot took an eternity to roll agonisingly wide of the post against the slope. The home side then forced a series of corners with Halesowen struggling to clear and took the lead in the 58th minute with HOBSON heading a cross from Bettney past the diving Clarke from 10 yards. Spurred on by the goal, the home side poured forward with Steve Johnson touching just wide on the hour.</p>
  <p>A 66th minute shot from Ross Collins flashed across the Alfreton goal before Halesowen equalised three minutes later against the run of play. A free-kick from Les Hines was headed on by Gavin Stone and when Turner failed to gather the ball the last defender cleared off the line but the ball struck ROSS COLLINS before hitting the back of the net. With Halesowen on the up at last, Andy Spencer struck the post in the 79th minute.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen were denied a replay two minutes from time when JOHNSON had all the time in the world to turn and smash beyond Clarke from 10 yards after Hobson headed on a Steve Circuit cross.</p>
