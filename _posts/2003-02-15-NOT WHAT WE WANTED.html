  <p>We travelled in hope of a point but ended up being completely overrun by a half-decent team.</p>

    Actually the result is a bit flattering to them. We had the better of the first half despite being one down to a rubbish goal, but when we went 2-0 it was really all over. Two more very poor goals from rubbish defending plus a sending off for Asa Charlton meant our mini-revival was emphatically over, and with Weymouth winning again we're now .
