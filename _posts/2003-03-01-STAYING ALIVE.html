  <p>After the recent disappointments, it's great to report a victory against a poor Ilkeston side who look certain to go down. Goals from  <b>new bloke Mark Danks</b>  (he scored for Bradford against the Albion in the Cup), a McHugh penalty ( <a href="/news/viewquicktime.asp?src=2003-03-01.mov">view video</a>  - thanks to Chris Davis) and a third from Jason has at least kept us within some sort of reach of safety.</p>
  <p>With all of the teams above us drawing we've 'closed' to  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=01032003">4 points of safety</a> , and with Cambridge visiting The Grove next Saturday let's hope we can get even closer.</p>
  <p>However, we've got the distraction of a League Cup semi-final against Chips'n'ham on Tuesday. It would be great to beat them, but it really is a case of concentrating on the league at the moment.</p>
