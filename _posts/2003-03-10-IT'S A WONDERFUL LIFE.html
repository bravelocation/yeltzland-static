<p>
  <p>In a fantastic and totally unexpected way, we're right back in with a chance of staying up after a stunning 3-0 victory away at Dover. Another goal from Mark Danks followed by two from Frazer (one a penalty) hasn't moved us up  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=10032003">the table</a>  but we're now only in the bottom four on goal difference - which has been much-improved tonight.</p>
  <p>Another tough game on Saturday when we visit 2nd place  <a href="http://www.chippenhamtownfc.co.uk/">Chippenham</a> . Now obviously we beat them in the Cup last week so we must have a chance, and let's hope we can continue our excellent run of late and pick up another point or three.</p>
