title: WHAT A WEEK!
match: Chippenham 1 Yeltz 2
---

<p>
  <p>With a second win in a week away to a top of the table side, the mighty Yeltz continued their fight to stay in the Premier Division with an excellent 2-1 victory at  <a href="http://www.chippenhamtownfc.co.uk/">Chippenham</a> . First half goals from  <b>Lee Williams and Gavin Stone</b>  took us into a 2-0 lead, and although they got one back on the hour, we hung on to get another valuable three points.</p>
  <p>We're still in the  bottom four  with Grantham beating Hastings and Hinckley beating Welling, but we've moved up a spot and are still only in the relegation zone on goal difference.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we're back at The Grove where we welcome  <a href="http://www.newport-county.co.uk/">Newport County</a> . They've been on a poor run of late, and we're only 5 points behind them even though they're in 10th place, so let's hope we can continue our recent excellent form and continue our fightback.</p>

  <p>Rejuvenated Halesowen reeled off their third straight away win to haul &#xD;
themselves closer to safety and extend their unbeaten run to five games.</p>
  <p>Halesowen weathered some early Chippenham pressure and slack defending &#xD;
allowed Charlie Griffin to nip in and head a Gary Horgan free-kick &#xD;
against the cross-bar in the 2nd minute. Lee Collins then cleared a &#xD;
Scott Walker cross from the left and in the 5th minute Adie Mings &#xD;
miscued his shot from the edge of the box when well placed.</p>
  <p>An 11th minute Les Hines free-kick was met by a Gavin Stone header but &#xD;
goalkeeper James Bittner scurried across his goal to make a fingertip &#xD;
save. Home skipper Colin Towler then cleared off his goal-line when Mark &#xD;
Danks took down a 14th minute right wing cross to shoot on target.</p>
  <p>Chippenham's direct approach continued to cause problems up the slope &#xD;
and Gary Bauress was forced to clear over his own bar in the 16th &#xD;
minute. Simon Charity then hit wide from 20 yards and Griffin lobbed &#xD;
over the bar in the 23rd minute.</p>
  <p>Jason Ashby nipped in to latch onto a long ball from Lee Williams in the &#xD;
25th minute but Bittner rushed out to make an acrobatic block. After a &#xD;
stoppage for injury to Bittner, Danks then turned in the area to produce &#xD;
a reflex stop from the keeper and in the 32nd minute Ashby almost &#xD;
connected after neat play by Danks and Williams. At the other end Tim &#xD;
Clarke grabbed Horgan's shot at the second attempt in the 42nd minute.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz then blasted the Bluebirds with a two-goal salvo in the final &#xD;
minute of the first half. Halesowen took the lead in the 45th minute &#xD;
with their own route-one style when a long ball from Danks bounced over &#xD;
Wayne Thorne and WILLIAMS lobbed the goalkeeper from 15 yards. Seconds &#xD;
later, STONE was on hand to touch home a right wing cross from close &#xD;
range that had escaped Collins under pressure to take a 2-0 half-time &#xD;
lead that looked unlikely just minutes earlier.</p>
  <p>Five minutes into the second half a stunned Chippenham could only watch &#xD;
when a Collins header hit the crossbar with Horgan standing on the line. &#xD;
However, Chippenham pulled a goal back in the 57th minute with Scott &#xD;
Walker rifling home the loose ball from 18 yards after Clarke had failed &#xD;
to hold a deep cross from the left under pressure following Tom Gould's &#xD;
30-yard free-kick. Three minutes later Griffin headed inches over the &#xD;
bar as it seemed the home side were about to apply the pressure down the &#xD;
slope.</p>
  <p>However, with Frazer McHugh and Williams pulling the strings in midfield &#xD;
the Yeltz were never seriously troubled in the final half-hour despite &#xD;
seven minutes of injury-time. Mings drove wide from the left in the 70th &#xD;
minute before Bittner collected a 75th minute curling free-kick from &#xD;
Hines.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's controlled and neat passing almost created a third goal in &#xD;
the 76th minute with McHugh hitting the outside of the angle as Danks &#xD;
and substitute Richard Leadbeater broke through the home defence. Five &#xD;
minutes from time Clarke tipped away a left-wing cross from Martin Paul &#xD;
for a corner, but the Yeltz easily held on to record a splendid win and &#xD;
condemn Chippenham to their first home league defeat since August.</p>
