  <p>Halesowen slipped to third from bottom after throwing away a promising &#xD;
half-time lead at Welling.</p>
  <p>Tim Clarke collected Gary Abbott's 2nd minute shot as the striker fell &#xD;
to the ground but Halesowen won the first corner on 6 minutes with &#xD;
Russell Edwards clearing the kick from Lee Williams.</p>
  <p>Halesowen then took a 9th minute lead when Mark Hone missed heading away &#xD;
a long clearance allowing Jason ASHBY to nip in and chip goalkeeper Glen &#xD;
Knight from 10 yards. Gary Bauress then suffered a head injury requiring &#xD;
stitches but battled on bravely with a bandage and Phil Trainer played a &#xD;
neat one-two for Michael Blackwood to strike wide of the post on 14 &#xD;
minutes. Clarke beat out Welling's first corner on 15 minutes but &#xD;
Halesowen were well on top and an 18th minute cross from Blackwood was &#xD;
met on the volley by Williams with Knight on hand to save. Blackwood &#xD;
then robbed Tim O'Shea in his own area but screwed his 5-yard shot wide &#xD;
in the 20th minute and three minutes later Knight beat away an 18-yard &#xD;
curling effort from Neil Gibson for a corner with the Wings flapping &#xD;
under sustained pressure.</p>
  <p>The second-half proved a different story with Welling playing more &#xD;
positively. Clarke failed to gather a 50th minute cross but Les Hines &#xD;
turned the ball away for a corner. Bauress headed the resulting corner &#xD;
from John Farley off his goal-line following a back-header at the near &#xD;
post. There was more than a hint of fortune about Welling's leveller on &#xD;
56 minutes when a 25-yard shot from Ray ABOAGYE took a cruel deflection &#xD;
to land in the corner of Clarke's net and a minute later an Abbott &#xD;
strike landed inches over Clarke's bar.</p>
  <p>Ashby curled a 62nd minute effort at Knight and Blackwood weaved through &#xD;
to shoot wide but Welling went on to gain the upper hand and cruised to &#xD;
victory with two late goals. In the 73rd minute ABBOTT stole in behind &#xD;
the Halesowen defence to head home Anthony Hogg's long free-kick at the &#xD;
far post. Hogg then struck the side-netting before Paul BOOTH beat the &#xD;
offside-trap and outpaced Bauress down the centre to hit past Clarke &#xD;
from 15-yards in the 77th minute. With their precious points lost in a &#xD;
poor second-half performance Halesowen could only play out the remaining &#xD;
minutes with Blackwood hitting an 86th minute shot to earn a corner.</p>
