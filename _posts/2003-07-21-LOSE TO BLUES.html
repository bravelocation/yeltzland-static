  <p>Ex-Halesowen manager Stewart Hall brought his pacy youngsters to the Grove &#xD;
but it was Halesowen's Leon Mitchell who hit inches wide in the 4th minute &#xD;
after turning defender Lee Vaughan with a clever back-heel. Mark Hallam's &#xD;
header then produced a reflex save from James Dormond in the 10th minute.</p>
  <p>City went ahead after 21 minutes through Andy Borrowman who slotted into an &#xD;
empty net when young goalkeeper Matt Harris raced off his line but &#xD;
completely missed his attempted headed clearance of a long ball. With the &#xD;
visitors on top, Craig Fagan struck the side-netting from a good position on &#xD;
the half-hour before Peter Till lashed home a second goal in the 44th minute &#xD;
as Halesowen's defence failed to clear a corner.</p>
  <p>Borrowman then hit the underside of the Halesowen bar from 5 yards straight &#xD;
after the break and Richard Colwell made a timely clearance from Fagan in &#xD;
the 73rd minute.</p>
  <p>Jason Ashby pulled a goal back with a simple tap-in after 76 minutes when &#xD;
goalkeeper Dormond dropped a Jamie March cross and four minutes later Andy &#xD;
Spencer cracked just wide as Halesowen finished more strongly.</p>
