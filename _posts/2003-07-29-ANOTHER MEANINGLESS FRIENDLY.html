  <p>This would be a disappointing result if it meant anything, but hopefully it's given Brendan some useful information as he tries to assemble a squad capable of challenging for the title this season. Brief details have been posted by Chas in  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/">YeltzTalk</a> .</p>
  <p>On Saturday we host Lancaster City of the Northern Premier at The Grove in what's quite an interesting match up.</p>
  <p>Voting's progressing nicely on this year's  <a href="/haveyoursay/halloffame/voteform.asp">election to the Yeltz Hall of Fame</a> , but if you haven't voted yet please pop along and have your say.</p>
