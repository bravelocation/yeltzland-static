match: Friendly  Yeltz 1 Lancaster 1
---

<p>
  <p>Another day, another friendly. We're having a consistent run in the pre-season warm-up, with yet another 1-1 draw with our goal again being scored by Simon Hollis.</p>
  <p>The results of our friendlies are generally misleading regarding our performance in the rest of the season, so I'm not sure what all this means. However there's only a couple of games left before the kick-off proper, with Hednesford the visitors on Tuesday and Nuneaton at The Grove on Saturday.</p>
  <p>Voting's progressing nicely on this year's  election to the Yeltz Hall of Fame , but if you haven't voted yet please pop along and have your say.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Lancaster opened the scoring in the 8th minute with their first attack when former Dundee striker Mike Yates turned to score at the second attempt after initially striking the post. Simon Hollis was gifted a 51st minute equaliser when visiting young goalkeeper Richard Whiteside miscued a clearance straight at him and he duly struck home into the bottom corner.</p>
  <p>Tall striker Steve Jones went close with a header for Lancaster and Yates brought a good save from Mark Gayle at the start of the second half. Leon Mitchell and Stuart Skidmore forced saves from Whiteside and late on Lancaster defender Farrell Kilbane - brother of former WBA favourite Kevin - headed just wide.</p>
