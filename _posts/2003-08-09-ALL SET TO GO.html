match: Friendly  Yeltz 5 Nuneaton 1
---

<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz finsihed their pre-season preparations in style with a frankly unbelievable 5-1 thrashing of Premier Division Nuneaton 5-1. Two goals from Jason, plus others from Hallam, Hollis (again) and Wray sends us into the league programme in excellent heart. Come On!!!</p>
  <p>Next week we begin the season proper with a trip to  <a href="http://www14.brinkster.com/theseasiders/">Clevedon</a> . They've been a mid-table side for the last couple of seasons - two years ago we took all six points off them - so let's hope we can start off an important year with a good result.</p>

  <p>Halesowen warmed up to hand out a five-goal thrashing to Dr Martens League hot favourites Nuneaton Borough in their final outing before the new season.</p>
  <p>In the sweltering heat Aaron O'Connor nodded wide in the 2nd minute and Micky Brown volleyed a Stuart Whittaker cross wide in the 12th minute for Borough.</p>
  <p>But with Halesowen looking sharp up front and solid at the back the visitors were soon on the wrong end of an avalanche of goals. A deep 13th minute right-wing cross from Simon Hollis beat goalkeeper Dan Quailey but struck the post allowing Jason Ashby to head home low down on the goal-line. On-trial goalkeeper Adam Wilcox parried a fierce 18th minute shot from Nuneaton's Whittaker out to O'Connor but he hit his effort high from just five yards.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz went two goals up in the 27th minute with Asa Charlton playing a delightful chip for Andy Spencer to cross perfectly for prolific goal-machine Simon Hollis to power home a 12-yard header.</p>
  <p>Mark Hallam added a third on the half-hour by trapping Richard Colwell's right-wing cross and flicking the ball past Quailey from close range. Late in the first half Wilcox saved an O'Connor volley from Brown's cross.</p>
  <p>Five minutes into the second half Jason Ashby hit home from the penalty spot to the goalkeeper's left after pushing in the area. A fifth goal followed in the 52nd minute when Ashby broke free down the right and rolled the ball into the path of substitute Shaun Wray to place home past a demoralised Quailey from six yards.</p>
  <p>Brown stepped up to score an 81st minute consolation goal for Nuneaton from a penalty after being brought down by Charlton.</p>
