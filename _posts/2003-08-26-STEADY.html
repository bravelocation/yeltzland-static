  <p>Stourport had two early chances with Richard Colwell clearing off the line in the &#xD;
2nd minute from Jan Mulders after Mark Gayle dropped a corner and Richard Ball flashed wide in the sixth minute when clear &#xD;
on goal.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz then stamped their authority on the game with Ben Steane putting Jason Ashby free &#xD;
in the 9th minute but his shot couldn't beat goalkeeper Lee Evans and in the 16th minute Simon Hollis struck wide &#xD;
after a lay-off from Mark Hallam. The flowing, incisive passing from Halesowen brought a 23rd minute goal when &#xD;
Lewis Baker played the ball to Hollis and he pushed the ball just wide of Evans allowing &#xD;
HALLAM to strike home into the centre of the net from 12 yards.</p>
  <p>Two minutes into the second half Darren Grocutt met a Hollis cross but he headed high when well &#xD;
placed. ASHBY added a second goal in the 53rd minute by stooping to head a Hollis corner into the net at &#xD;
the near post. Substitute Leon Mitchell blazed over the bar from a Baker pass on 70 minutes before the &#xD;
Yeltz weathered a late storm.</p>
  <p>Stourport substitute Anthony Robinson was pulled back by Baker in the 75th minute in the area &#xD;
and although Robinson's penalty kick beat Gayle the ball rebounded off the inside of the post and across the goal-line &#xD;
into safety. Ball was then clean through in the 84th minute but Gayle saved with his legs and Gayle was in action again &#xD;
to make another important reflex block in the last minute.</p>
