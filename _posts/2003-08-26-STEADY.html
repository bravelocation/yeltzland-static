  <p>The mighty Yeltz continued on their winning ways with a decent 2-0 victory away to local rivals Stourport Swifts. Goals from the strikeforce of Hallam and Ashby means we've moved up to  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=26082003">7th in the early table</a> , five points behind early leaders Redditch, Sutton and Solihull.

  <p>On Saturday we kick-off our FA Cup campaign away to  <a href="http://www.bedworthunited.co.uk/">Bedworth</a> . They've had a pretty poor start to the season with just two draws, and even though the  <a href="http://www.thefa.com/application?origin=template.jsp&amp;pageid=maximise&amp;subContentType=1&amp;pageName=facup_thefacup_thedraw&amp;pillar=facup&amp;contentId=22383&amp;contentType=1">prize money</a>  for the early rounds is still a significant amount so it's important we have a good run.</p>
  <p>The closing date for voting for this year's  <a href="/haveyoursay/halloffame/voteform.asp">election to the Yeltz Hall of Fame</a>  is Saturday, so if you haven't voted yet and you want to you best get a move on.</p>

  <p>Stourport had two early chances with Richard Colwell clearing off the line in the &#xD;
2nd minute from Jan Mulders after Mark Gayle dropped a corner and Richard Ball flashed wide in the sixth minute when clear &#xD;
on goal.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz then stamped their authority on the game with Ben Steane putting Jason Ashby free &#xD;
in the 9th minute but his shot couldn't beat goalkeeper Lee Evans and in the 16th minute Simon Hollis struck wide &#xD;
after a lay-off from Mark Hallam. The flowing, incisive passing from Halesowen brought a 23rd minute goal when &#xD;
Lewis Baker played the ball to Hollis and he pushed the ball just wide of Evans allowing &#xD;
HALLAM to strike home into the centre of the net from 12 yards.</p>
  <p>Two minutes into the second half Darren Grocutt met a Hollis cross but he headed high when well &#xD;
placed. ASHBY added a second goal in the 53rd minute by stooping to head a Hollis corner into the net at &#xD;
the near post. Substitute Leon Mitchell blazed over the bar from a Baker pass on 70 minutes before the &#xD;
Yeltz weathered a late storm.</p>
  <p>Stourport substitute Anthony Robinson was pulled back by Baker in the 75th minute in the area &#xD;
and although Robinson's penalty kick beat Gayle the ball rebounded off the inside of the post and across the goal-line &#xD;
into safety. Ball was then clean through in the 84th minute but Gayle saved with his legs and Gayle was in action again &#xD;
to make another important reflex block in the last minute.</p>
