  <p>Halesowen cruised into the next round to meet Corby Town after a controlled display against the Greenbacks.</p>
  <p>Reserve goalkeeper Matt Lowe made a good debut and punched clear a 10th minute corner before Halesowen went on the offensive. In the 16th minute former Bedworth midfielder Ben Steane curled in a 20-yard free-kick to force home goalkeeper Macaulay Iyayi into a flying save. Two minutes later Iyayi grabbed a deep cross from Jamie March and on 24 minutes Simon Hollis played a dangerous ball towards goal but Lewis Baker was fouled on the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>Bedworth's best chance of the afternoon fell to Stephen Padmore in the 28th minute when he turned to unleash a 25-yard shot but Lowe did well to turn the ball onto the outside of the post for a corner.</p>
  <p>On the half-hour Mark Hallam played a splendid long ball for Jason Ashby but Iyayi raced off his line to save and then combined with defender Danial Hollywood to block when Hollis hit the rebound towards goal. A minute before half-time Richard Colwell crossed for Ashby and as the ball broke March fired high over the bar.</p>
  <p>Halesowen continued to be well on top after the break although the decisive breakthrough took a while to materialise. On 47 minutes Neil Smith nodded a Hollis corner wide and after 52 minutes Iyayi picked out a Hollis cross with one hand from under the angle.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz finally went ahead on the hour when HOLLIS picked up a loose ball to drill into the bottom corner from 12 yards after Crowley failed to clear from Mitchell. Halesowen went close to increasing their tally when substitute Bryan Small drove wide on 70 minutes, Mitchell hit over the bar a minute later and Hollis crossed for Ashby to fire high on 76 minutes. A second goal arrived in the 77th minute when ASHBY powerfully headed home a free-kick from Hollis and with the visitors totally in charge Hollis played a perfect pass for Ashby to drill just wide in the 82nd minute.</p>
