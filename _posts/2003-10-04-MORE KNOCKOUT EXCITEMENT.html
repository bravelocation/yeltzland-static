title: MORE KNOCKOUT EXCITEMENT
match: FAT  Yeltz 4 Stourport 3
---

<p>
  <p>Our excellent run in cup competitions continued with an exciting 4-3 win over local rivals Stourport Swifts. We took the lead through goals from Lewis Baker and Leon Mitchell before they got one back just before half-time. Jason made it 3-1 with what my source tells me was "the softest goal you've ever seen", but then they came back to 3-3 before Simon Hollis scored an excellent winner.</p>
  <p>This means we're through to the 1st Round when we travel to play Team Bath in an interesting tie on November 1st.</p>
  <p>Next week takes us on an epic journey up to the North-East to play  <a href="http://www.spartans.freeserve.co.uk/">Blyth Spartans</a> . They're in the bottom half of the Northern Premier, but have an excellent cup tradition so it should be a cracking game. Not sure about the way the FA "regionalised" the draw - especially when you live in Brighton - but let's hope we can continue our good run.</p>
  <p>With DJ away, he won't be providing a match report this week so I've provided links to a couple of reports on other web sites. I also hear Dot filled in on the PA which I'm very sad to have missed :-)</p>
