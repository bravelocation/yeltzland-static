title: LONG TRIP IN VAIN
match: FAC3Q  Blyth 2 Yeltz 1
---

<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz came away from what must be their longest ever away trip empty handed, going down 2-1 in the FA Cup to Blyth Spartans. They took the lead in the first half, but then we equalised through Jason (who else), before they clinched it in the second half.</p>
  <p>Once again, in absense of a Halesowen-biased report I've posted links to reports on various other websites.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we play our first league game for nearly a month when we visit old rivals  <a href="http://www.t-ender.co.uk/">Gloucester City</a> . They've been on a good cup run themselves, but we need to use our games in hand well to get back up to the top, so let's hope for a good result.</p>
