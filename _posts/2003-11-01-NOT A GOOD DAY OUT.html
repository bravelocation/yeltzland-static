match: FAT  Team Bath 0 Yeltz 0

<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz remain in the FA Trophy after a 0-0 draw against the "students" of Team Bath. Unfortunately I wasn't at the game, but from what  <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/fbathcityfrm2.showMessage?topicID=2148.topic"&gt;Chris has to say</a>  on the Bath City forum it doesn't sound as though it was the best away trip we've ever had. I'd be very interested in the views of anyone else who was there, and particularly if anyone from  <a href="http://www.teambath.com"&gt;Team Bath</a>  would like to give us the benefit of their educated views.  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/"&gt;YeltzTalk</a>  is waiting.</p>
  <p>The replay is on Tuesday, so let's hope we can get through and start on a decent run in the Trophy for once. It's the first of a run of three home games, including the visit of Bedworth next Saturday.</p>

  <p>Halesowen forced a Tuesday replay with their third consecutive clean sheet in a dreary contest that provided little entertainment to enthuse the sparse crowd.</p>
  <p>But the major talking point amongst Halesowen followers was how the lavishly public-funded Team Bath project denied them even the most basic of facilities that are now customary at far lower levels of football. The situation is likely to be taken up by the Halesowen Town Supporters Association making its opinion known by letters of complaint to the relevant parties.</p>
  <p>On the pitch, the almost artificial University of Bath campus setting with the pitch surrounded by an athletics track produced an instantly forgettable game. Andy Spencer won Halesowen's first corner in the 5th minute but Richard Kavanagh's kick was easily cleared. Dan Jones then tidied up in the Yeltz defence on 8 minutes when Chris Lewis beat the offside trap. Bath's first corner on 10 minutes from Luke Prince came to nothing before Tom Stocco again beat the offside trap but fired wide from 15 yards out. Goalkeeper Matt Lowe then collected a 20-yard Mike Gillingham shot and caught Andy Tilson's effort from a Prince free-kick in the 14th minute.</p>
  <p>Home goalkeeper Chris Gibson raced off his line to clear from leading marksman Jason Ashby on 19 minutes and then produced a fingertip stop to turn away Andy Spencer's 15-yard drive after 27 minutes. Opposite number Lowe then did well to take Gillingham's 36th minute corner under pressure in a crowded goal area.</p>
  <p>The second-half misery continued with neither side looking likely to break the stalemate although Lowe saved low down on 53 minutes when Gillingham cut in from the right. Simon Hollis then forced a 57th minute save from Gibson and Lowe had to alert at the other end in the 70th minute to keep out an attempted lob from Prince. Ali Otto then shot over the bar from 10-yards in the 73rd minute and Lewis headed a 73rd minute corner from Paul Tisdale over the bar. In the dying seconds, Halesowen substitute Leon Mitchell saw his 20-yard shot easily saved by Gibson.</p>
