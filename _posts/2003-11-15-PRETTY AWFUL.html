title: PRETTY AWFUL
match: Yeltz 1 Shepshed 1
---

<p>
  <p>In a disappointing display at the Grove, the mighty Yeltz could only manage to get one point&#xD;
		against bottom of the table Shepshed.</p>
  <p>They weren't very good at all - not surprisingly seeing as they haven't a single win this season - &#xD;
		but after we took the lead through a scrappy Lewis Baker flick we seemed to assume it was all over,&#xD;
		and showed no urgency at all to score again. The inevitable happened when they scored in the second half,&#xD;
		and although we roused ourselves at the end it was very frustrating only to get a draw.</p>
  <p>We're away at  <b>Ilkeston</b>  on Tuesday in the League. they're on a very poor run, so let's hope &#xD;
		we can come away with all three points this time.</p>

  <P>Halesowen threw away two valuable home points by allowing rock-bottom &#xD;
Shepshed back into the game to earn a draw.</P>

    In a lively Yeltz opening, Leon Mitchell curled wide from 20 yards in the &#xD;
2 minute and Simon Hollis cut in from the left to unleash a 20-yard &#xD;
shot which fell just wide on 10 minutes. Mitchell then beat his defender but &#xD;
planted the ball high over the bar in the 15 minute and goalkeeper &#xD;
Andy Harland collected Ben Steane's shot a minute later.

    With Shepshed packing their defence, Mitchell put past the post in the &#xD;
26 minute when clear on goal and Harland beat away Asa Charlton's &#xD;
29 minute free-kick. Jason Ashby then latched onto a long ball and &#xD;
rounded Harland only to see his 33 minute shot cleared off the &#xD;
line.

    Halesowen finally took the lead in the 34 minute with Lewis &#xD;
BAKER turning home Andy Spencer's shot from close range with a crafty back-heel. &#xD;
Harland then produced a flying save in the 38 minute to keep out &#xD;
Ashby's header from a Hollis cross with Halesowen looking on course for a &#xD;
comfortable win.

    Home goalkeeper Matt Lowe was finally brought into action in the &#xD;
39 minute to keep out Jason Weafer's free-kick and at the other end &#xD;
Charlton made a fine 42 minute run down the left wing but fellow &#xD;
full-back Richard Colwell put the cross over the bar.

  <P>Despite being without a league win this season, hard-working Shepshed came &#xD;
out to produce a gutsy second-half performance and fully deserved their share of &#xD;
the points.</P>
  <P>
    The lack-lustre home side suffered a blow in the 49 minute when &#xD;
goalkeeper Lowe was stretchered off with a jaw injury following a collision with &#xD;
Simon Forsdick. After the re-start Baker made a crucial interception to deny &#xD;
Jason Weafer in the penalty area and Halesowen's replacement goalkeeper Mark &#xD;
Sheils kept out a dipping 20-yard strike from Damien Heskey.

    Ashby was first to meet a long clearance from Sheils on the hour but flicked &#xD;
the ball just wide and then chipped just wide on 68 minutes. Mitchell scuffed &#xD;
the ball from a good position in the 71 minute before Shepshed &#xD;
levelled in the 76 minute with FORSDICK firmly heading home a left &#xD;
wing cross.

    Spencer blasted a loose ball over the bar from 20-yards in the &#xD;
84 minute and Halesowen almost grabbed a 90 minute &#xD;
winner when a curling shot from Hollis beat Harland but rebounded off the far &#xD;
post.
