<p>
  <p>Prodigal son Steve Piearce made an excellent return to The Grove with two second half goals in a 3-0 win over Clevedon. With Pie-arce and Jason up front I reckon we'd be a match for anyone in this league, but I'm not sure exactly what Steve's availability is - if anyone knows can they let us know on  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/">YeltzTalk</a> ?</p>
  <p>We're now  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=14122003">5th in the table</a>  and can move up to 3rd with a victory over Taunton at home on Tuesday. It's important we keep our excellent run going if we are going to challenge for the title this year.</p>
  <p>After being rightly nagged for not updating it sooner, there's a new vote on the site for your Xmas pleasure.</p>

  <p>Former favourite Steve Piearce made a dream return to the Grove with two goals &#xD;
in a comfortable Halesowen victory. Piearce notched over fifty goals in two &#xD;
seasons at Halesowen in the late 1990s before moving to Hereford and already &#xD;
looks to have formed a formidable forward partnership with goal-machine Jason &#xD;
Ashby, already on 23 goals for the season.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen started shakily with Darren Grocutt tidying up a goalmouth &#xD;
scramble in the 5th minute with Clevedon's Fidel Richards eventually &#xD;
striking wide. From that point on there was only one winner as Clevedon failed &#xD;
to create any meaningful chances for the rest of the game.</p>
  <p>Paul Treago was on top form early on in the Clevedon goal keeping out a fierce &#xD;
7th minute drive from 15 yards by Jason Ashby after Ben Steane laid &#xD;
off the ball. Piearce and Ashby then combined five minutes later with Ashby &#xD;
flicking the ball off for Piearce to force another fine save from Treago. A &#xD;
Steane shot flashed wide on 13 minutes and Andy Spencer made a long run from &#xD;
midfield in the 14th minute but he hit wide with better options &#xD;
available.</p>
  <p>It was no surprise when Dan JONES rose at the far post to squeeze a header into &#xD;
the net from a Simon Hollis corner to give the Yeltz a 26th minute &#xD;
lead. Clevedon then made a double substitution in attack but the move had little &#xD;
effect and it was Halesowen who finished the first half strongly with Neil Smith &#xD;
shooting wide on 42 minutes and Spencer almost latching onto a through ball from &#xD;
Steane just before the break.</p>
  <p>Spencer won an early second half corner before Halesowen deservedly increased &#xD;
their lead in the 53rd minute when Steane made a long solo run from &#xD;
midfield and set up PIEARCE to turn on the penalty spot and fire past Treago &#xD;
from 12 yards. Ashby then set up Steane on the hour but he screwed wide from 15 &#xD;
yards out.</p>
  <p>In a rare counter-attack, a casual back header from Jones almost let in &#xD;
Clevedon's Ryan Weisburg in the 67th minute but the under-worked &#xD;
goalkeeper Matt Lowe did just enough to distract the substitute striker. With &#xD;
little else on offer from the visitors Hollis blasted over the bar in the &#xD;
68th minute and then saw his shot blocked on the line five minutes &#xD;
later with Piearce forcing a corner from the rebound. From the corner a &#xD;
wide-angled shot from Hollis beat the Clevedon defence and PIEARCE was on hand &#xD;
to convert his second goal from close range in the 73rd minute. In &#xD;
the final ten minutes Halesowen introduced 18-year youngster Mark Lowry who had &#xD;
only just made the move from Stafford Rangers.</p>
