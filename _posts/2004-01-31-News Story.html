  <p>The recent wet weather meant our game on Saturday at Shepshed was called off, but it wasn't too bad a day with Redditch dropping points again. The closeness of the league means we've dropped back to  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=31012004">5th place in the table</a> , but if we can put a consistent run together and win our games in hand we can still challenge for the title.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday we play Solihull Borough at The Grove - a game we need to win to keep in touch. They're one of the teams in contention for a top seven finish, so it's a very important game once again.</p>
