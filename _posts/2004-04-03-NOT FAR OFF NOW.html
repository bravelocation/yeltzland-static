title: NOT FAR OFF NOW
match: Evesham 1 Yeltz 2
---

<p>
  <p>An excellent away win by the mighty Yeltz at Evesham means that we're in sight of clinching that all-important top seven spot for promotion into the Premier Division next season. Despite going behind once again, we came back through goals from Jimmy Haarhoff and Nathan Lamey to win 2-1.</p>
  <p>We're back up to  2nd in the table  although both Gloucester and Cirencester have games in hand. It's complicated because several of the top 9 still have to play each other, but I'm pretty confident in saying if we win our two games over the holiday weekend we're definitely up.</p>
  <p>Those two games are against Sutton Coldfield (away on Saturday) and then Bromsgrove (at The Grove on Monday). It's not going to be easy, but we are on an excellent run of form under the new management regime, so let's hope we can continue this for a little longer and ensure our promotion as soon as we can.</p>

  <p>Halesowen climbed to second place in the table after recovering from a goal down in a poor start to end up worthy winners. The meeting brought together the two previous Solihull managers in opposite dug-outs and ended with Paul Holleran maintaining his unbeaten managerial record at the Halesowen helm.</p>
  <p>The Robins started brightly and Halesowen had a let-off after just 40 seconds when Danny Williams latched onto a bad back-pass but full-back Richard Colwell cleared off the line. Jermaine Clark's 6th minute shot was then parried away by goalkeeper Mark Sheils with the loose ball rolling agonisingly wide. David Foy headed a 7th minute Dave Haywood corner inches wide for Halesowen but Evesham deservedly took the lead in the 9th minute when centre-half Dan Jones ducked out of a header in his own penalty area allowing WILLIAMS to fire home from 12 yards. Sheils then raced out of his area in the 13th minute to deny Williams before Halesowen finally stepped up a gear.</p>
  <p>Former Halesowen goalkeeper Tim Clarke denied Nathan Lamey in the 17th minute when free on goal with Simon Hollis then heading Lamey's cross tamely at Clarke. Haywood's corner curled just wide of Clarke's post on 23 minutes and on the half-hour Lewis Baker's acrobatic volley from 6 yards fell just wide.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's pressure finally paid off with a 35th minute equaliser when the Evesham defence allowed Jimmy HAARHOFF to advance on goal and roll a 20-yard shot into the corner of the net. Lamey then twice hit wide from 25 yards after 37 and 38 minutes and with Halesowen finishing the half strongly Haarhoff fed Lamey from a Hollis break but the striker put the ball wide from 12 yards after side-stepping his defender.</p>
  <p>LAMEY made amends by notching Halesowen's winning goal in the 55th minute by taking down the ball and striking a positive shot from the edge of the area with Clarke only able to reach the ball with his fingertips. Baker then just failed to connect with a dangerous ball across goal from Lamey on the hour. With the visitors finishing in control of the game a 25-yard volley from Haywood was turned away for a corner by Clarke in the 74th minute and Haarhoff then put substitute Jason Moore clear on 79 minutes but Clarke made another fine save.</p>
