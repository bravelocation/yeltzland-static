  <p>Just four weeks to go until the start of what is going to be a very interesting season, with lots of new opponents due to the long overdue reorganisation of the football pyramid.</p>
  <p>The  <a href="/anorak/results.aspx?season=2004&amp;team=Halesowen+Town">fixture list</a>  is out now, starting with a home game against Aylesbury and ending with an away trip to Hitchin.</p>
  <p>We started the friendly season yesterday with a 1-0 loss to Evesham. More news if I receive any, or see Chris's comment in  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/">YeltzTalk</a> .</p>
  <p>We play our regular friendly against the Albion on Wednesday at The Grove, before hosting Worcester City on Saturday.</p>
