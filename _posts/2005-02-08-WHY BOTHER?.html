<p>
  <p>I think I've been consistent over the years in saying I don't care about these "midweek" cups (League Cup and Senior Cups), but even I'm a bit disappointed in getting completely stuffed by Sutton Coldfield 4-0. Full details if you can bear it in  Dave's match report .</p>
  <p>We're back to more important matters on Saturday when Solihull come to The Grove in the League. After they beat us earlier in the season we really need to gain revenge and more importantly three points to keep our promotion challenge going.</p>

  <p>Damian Markman notched a hat-trick as Sutton took full advantage of a Halesowen nightmare that saw them register their worst ever defeat under manager Paul Holleran.</p>
  <p>On a mud-heap pitch, Sutton proved to be more committed and were first to the ball as they played the appalling conditions much better than higher league Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Steve Pope made an important challenge to deny Markman in the 5th minute and three minutes later a Sutton free-kick was cleared after novice on-loan Halesowen goalkeeper Matt Jones raced off his line to bring down Narveed Arshad just outside the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Marksman MARKMAN gave the Royals the lead in the 14th by easily slotting the ball under Matt Jones in a one-on-one when a long ball forward stuck in the ankle-deep mud. Two minutes later Markman crossed from the right and ARSHAD touched the ball onto the post with goalkeeper Matt Jones then fumbling the ball into the net for Sutton's second goal. On 23 minutes MARKMAN latched onto a long ball to hit past the uncomfortable Matt Jones on the half-volley to give Sutton an incredible 3-0 lead with their 11th goal in the last 55 minutes of League Cup football.</p>
  <p>Mark Wolsey struck wide twice before half-time with Halesowen then making a double substitution up front at the interval. But with no improvement from the Yeltz, Wolsey hit a 50th minute free-kick wide from the edge of the area and David Berks struck just wide on the hour with the hosts in complete control.</p>
  <p>MARKMAN completed his hat-trick in the 70th minute by heading home Wolsey's right-wing cross and three minutes later full-back Sam Wilson went close from the left of the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Nathan Lamey finally hit a token effort just wide for Halesowen in the 71st minute and Cowley hit Halesowen's only shot on-target at home goalkeeper Justin Bray in the 78th minute of a desperately disappointing performance from the visitors.</p>
