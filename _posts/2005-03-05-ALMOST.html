  <p>Despite having most of the play, the indomitable Yeltz for once failed to score and had to settle for a 0-0 draw at The Grove against Bath. No match report from DJ this week I'm afraid, so if any one would like to fill in for him, please feel free (use the link below).</p>
  <p>In other results, Bedford only drew, Chips and Ham and Histon were called off, Merthyr won but Aylesbury lost which means we're still looking good for the play-offs but it's looking a bit more unlikely we can challenge for the title. Still there are 10 games to go so it's far from over.</p>

    On Saturday we make the long trip down to  in the league. They're having a patchy season but still have hopes of making the play-offs. We beat them 3-1 earlier in the season, and a repeat of that result would go down very well.
