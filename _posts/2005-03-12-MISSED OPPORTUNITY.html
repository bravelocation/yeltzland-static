    In a disappointing result, the indomitable Yeltz failed to take advantage of other teams dropping points when we lost 1-0 down at Tiverton. By all accounts it was a difficult pitch, but we didn't play well and didn't deserve anything out of the game. Still, with only Aylesbury winning in the top 8 we remain in .

  <p>On Tuesday we have a massive match at The Grove when Histon are the visitors. They have plenty of games in hand and look on paper to be the only realistic challengers to Chips and Ham, but it's been a strange season so far and Histon losing at home to Gloucester was quite a shock. We just HAVE to win if we are going to win the league, but we gave them a decent game at their place earlier in the season, and I'm confident we can do it!</p>
  <p>I'm sure you know already by now, but make sure you note that the last away game of the season is now on April 23rd at Hitchin, as it's been confirmed that it and the Team Barth games on the last two weekends have been switched.</p>

  <p>Attendance: 519</p>
  <p>Halesowen failed to capitalise on a series of slip-ups by their play-off rivals and were deservedly beaten by a solitary goal at mid-table Tiverton in a poor game.</p>
  <p>Out of sorts Halesowen only managed three real attempts on goal afternoon and barely troubled home goalkeeper Ovendale on a heavily sanded surface.</p>
  <p>The hosts almost took a 2nd minute lead through Iain Harvey at the far post and in the 11th minute Stewart Yetton went close from Steve Winter's free-kick. Chris Taylor then made an excellent 33rd minute reflex save from Winter's shot.</p>
  <p>Tivvy grabbed the winning goal a minute before half-time when Nicki Preston missed a header from Ovendale's long clearance from goal leaving leading scorer Jamie MUDGE in plenty of space to score his 28th goal of the season.</p>
  <p>Mudge proved a constant danger and was given too much time again on the hour as he flashed a low shot just wide of the post and then went close again three minutes later.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to struggle in the second half and made little impact up-front despite a double substitution in the 62nd minute.</p>
