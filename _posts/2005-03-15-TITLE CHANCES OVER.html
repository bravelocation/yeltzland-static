title: TITLE CHANCES OVER
match: Yeltz 0 Histon 2
---

<p>
  <p>I don't think there's any chance we can win automatic promotion now after a disappointing 2-0 loss to Histon at The Grove last night. Despite having a reasonable amount of the play, we didn't score for the third match running and had no answer when they scored two in the second-half.</p>
  <p>However, let's not get too down-hearted. We are still in an excellent position for clinching a play-off place (which is probably what we deserve on performances so far), as long as we press on in our remaining games. We start with a home game against a struggling Rugby which I'd hope we can get 3 points from. We can do it!</p>

  <p>Halesowen's play-off hopes took a massive dive with a disappointing defeat in a game that failed to live up to expectations as title favourites Histon moved up to second place in the table.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz made an eager start but were forced to clear a 13th minute corner and a 14th minute free-kick as the visitors packed the 6-yard box.</p>
  <p>Alex Cowley intercepted play in midfield in the 16th minute but goalkeeper Lance Key beat Nathan Lamey to his through ball and ten minutes later Jimmy Haarhoff almost latched onto a back-header from Lewis Baker. Home goalkeeper Chris Taylor lost the ball in the 31st minute but recovered to make a reflex save to deny Colin Vowden and on 34 minutes Ian Cambridge hit a 20-yard free-kick over the bar after Neil Andrews was brought down.</p>
  <p>Dave Haywood hit a speculative 35-yard effort over the bar in the 38th minute after winning the ball well in midfield but Baker then missed the best chance of the half by heading a loose ball wide of an open goal in the 41st minute. A minute later Nicki Preston planted a firm header wide from Cowley's free-kick after Lamey was fouled.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz dominated the start of the second half against the disappointing visitors who looked content with a draw and in the 52nd minute Key lost control of the ball when clearing but Simon Forsdick shot wide with the goalkeeper out of his area. Cowley then embarked on a weaving run to set Lamey free but Key saved. On the hour Key then saved from Lamey near his right-hand post with Baker hitting over the bar in a good spell of pressure.</p>
  <p>After barely threatening the Halesowen goal all evening, Histon snatched a 63rd minute lead when a long throw in was only partly cleared and Taylor dropped the ball for Jamie BARKER to hammer home into the roof of the net from close range.</p>
  <p>As Halesowen ran out of ideas, Neil Kennedy shot wide before Neil ANDREWS made it 2-0 in the 75th minute with an easy follow-up into an empty net after Barker's shot was deflected.</p>
  <p>In the final minute Halesowen substitute Jason Moore shot meekly past the post when clear with demoralised Halesowen failing to score for the third consecutive game.</p>
