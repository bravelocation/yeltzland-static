  <p>Steve Farmer buried a second-half header to inflict the first pre-season defeat on his former Conference North team-mates.</p>
  <p>Roger Ashby's Nuneaton dominated the opening-half, with Halesowen struggling to make any impression in midfield. A neat interchange almost let in David Staff in the 7th minute and two minutes later Staff hit just wide from a 20-yard free-kick. On 18 minutes another free-kick on the edge of Halesowen's penalty area was wasted by Martin Reeves.</p>
  <p>Rob Oddy left the field after receiving lengthy treatment to a head injury following an unnecessary challenge by Dave Haywood on the half-hour. Five minutes before the delayed interval Brian Quailey almost met Michael Frew's cross before Frew fired a shot at home goalkeeper Chris Taylor just before the half-time whistle.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz enjoyed a much better second-half with Ian Cooper's drive saved low-down by Darren Acton in the 46th minute and after a lull in proceedings, Nathan Lamey blasted wide on the hour.</p>
  <p>Former Halesowen midfielder Andy Spencer was introduced as a Nuneaton substitute in the 58th minute after recovering from his lengthy injury and on 67 minutes Taylor raced out of goal to save at the feet of another Nuneaton substitute, Rich Saunders.</p>
  <p>A Simon Forsdick cross was headed away for a corner on 70 minutes with Farmer forcing a save from substitute goalkeeper Ryan Poole at his post. FARMER then found himself in space to head home the winning goal in the 72nd minute following a deep cross from Lamey. Lamey was then invited to leave the pitch together with Gary Fitzpatrick by the referee following a touchline skirmish two minutes later.</p>
  <p>Nuneaton created their best chance with seven minutes remaining when highly rated 18-year old substitute David Blenkinsopp flashed a header against the crossbar and Spencer stabbed the rebound wide.</p>
