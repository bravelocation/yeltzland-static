<h3>Match Report from Darren</h3>

  <p>Halesowen ran out comfortable winners at Damson Parkway against a competitive Solihull Borough side showing many changes from the team relegated from last year's Southern League Premier Division.</p>
  <p>Halesowen threatened first on the right in the 8th minute as a cross from Nathan Lamey was headed at keeper Bray to make a good save from Stuart Pierpoint. Pope then headed another Lamey cross, this time from the left, well over on 17 minutes.</p>
  <p>Lamey was again involved on 22 minutes as he shot wide after good work with Nick Smith. Solihull rarely threatened the Yeltz goal although they had plenty of possession.</p>
  <p>Lamey put over a good ball to Smith, who headed back for Forinton to win a corner on 23 minutes, before Solihull broke on 27 minutes as Egan shot against his own player wide after good work by Wellington on the wing.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally took the lead on 44 minutes when good work in the box allowed NATHAN LAMEY to break free and slot home.</p>
  <p>The second half began brightly for the Yeltz, and on 59 minutes, Howard Forinton struck a shot against Bray that was well saved after good work between Forinton and a fit again Strachan.</p>
  <p>On 65 minutes, good work on the right by Wellington allowed himself time to put in a deep cross that was well gathered by Town keeper Chris Taylor.</p>
  <p>A minute later and HOWARD FORINTON added to his pre-season goal tally when Pope played a deep ball to him from the right and the new signing was able to lift the ball into the net over an advancing Bray.</p>
  <p>The rest of the game saw several more replacements for both sides as Halesowen held on comfortably for a fourth consecutive pre-season win and a third clean sheet in those four games.</p>
