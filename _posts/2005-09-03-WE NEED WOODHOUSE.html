  <p>Barbara that is - to help us hold a lead. By my reckoning (which is obviously suspect) we've been ahead in every game so far this season, and on Saturday it happened once again. A draw at Grantham isn't that bad, but we've unfortunately we seem to have settled in to our mid-table position despite only losing one game so far. Full details in  Darren's match report .</p>
  <p>Next Saturday we set off on the long road to maybe Wembley with an FA Cup First Qualifying Round against  <a href="http://www.fchd.btinternet.co.uk/S-NORMAA.HTM">South Normanton Athletic</a> . They finished bottom of the Northern Counties East Division One last season and have lost both their league games so far, so it would be a massive shock if we didn't manage to get through. I think I'm confident ;-)</p>

  <p>Halesowen again failed to hold onto a lead against Grantham at the South Kesteven Stadium.</p>
  <p>After a quiet opening from both sides, Cowley put over a 6th minute corner which the keeper punched clear under pressure. A minute later Lamey was lucky to escape a caution with a late challenge on Steve Julian.</p>
  <p>A Willis Francis free kick on 18 minutes was struck tamely wide after an ill-advised Cowley throw in nearly let in a Grantham player who was fouled by the returning Dave Haywood.</p>
  <p>A Lamey free kick on 25 minutes by Lamey was just missed at the far post by a diving Steve Farmer, and on 36 Lamey was again the provider from the right to Howard Forinton who's header was well saved by the keeper.</p>
  <p>The second half began with Smith just hitting wide after good work from a Lamey free kick resulted in Farmer heading back across the goal.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz took the lead on 57 minutes when a great cross from Alex Cowley was headed home by NATHAN LAMEY. Again the Yeltz failed to capitalise and struggled to hold the ball during the closing stages, and from a long ball from the goalkeeper up the field, Pope and Farmer clashed to allow substitute MICHAEL SNEDDON to give Grantham a point.</p>
