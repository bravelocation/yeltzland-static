  <p>In a glass half-full sort of way I thought I'd list some positive things:</p>
  <p>Not too bad is it? Still as I'm sure many of you will remind us this week there's another more miserable way of looking at the current situation.</p>
  <p>Before Saturday's cup game Redditch are the visitors in the Birmingham Senior Cup on Tuesday.</p>

  <p>An excellent all round performance from Halesowen earnt them 3 valuable points for the first time since August Bank Holiday.</p>
  <p>A bright start by the Yeltz with Cowley swinging in a free kick which was headed just wide. Chesham's Steve Sinclair hit just over on 3 minutes after good work down the left.</p>
  <p>A move between Forsdick and Lamey on 7 minutes allowed Nick Smith to hit a left footed drive which was tipped over by Bonfield. A diagonal pass from Johnson on 9 allowed Forsdick to break clear but he just failed to hit the target as the ball went over.</p>
  <p>Halesowen continued to build on their early pressure, with Forinton driving a shot across the face of the goal on 18 minutes but Forsdick was just unable to reach it. Forsdick again went close a minute later but just over ran the ball after rounding the keeper.</p>
  <p>Forinton seized upon a poor Chesham back pass on 26 but the keeper recovered well to save. Chesham broke clear on 27 minutes but Andre Scarlett's effort was deflected over. Forinton linked up well with Cowley on 29 with Cowley having his left foot shot pushed wide. From the resulting corner Lamey rounded the keeper but his pull back was well defended by Chesham's solid looking rearguard action.</p>
  <p>Another good cross from Cowley was just missed by Nick Smith on 40 minutes, but a minute later following a corner the ball fell to HOWARD FORINTON who played an excellent 1-2 with Steve Pope before scoring his 2nd league goal of the season and put Halesowen into a deserved half time lead.</p>
  <p>From the restart Coleman was called on to tip over from John Lawford as Halesowen were nearly caught cold. Cowley broke clear on 53 minutes but Bowden-Haase recovered to clear the danger. A cross shot from Forinton just missed Lamey at the far post a minute later.</p>
  <p>A through ball from Forsdick allowed Cowley to break free on 58 minutes but the keeper was alert to the danger and cleared the ball for a throw in. Amos headed a Forinton cross over on 65 minutes.</p>
  <p>With Chesham coming in to the game a little more mid way through the second half, Dave Haywood gave a penalty away after pushing the Chesham forward. &#xD;
Graham Hall's right foot shot was excellently saved by Dean Coleman and as the follow up was hit towards the goal Nick Preston handled. The referee only booked Preston but awarded Chesham a second penalty in a minute. This time John Lawford struck a low left foot shot and this time Coleman produced a fantastic save to push the ball over the bar.</p>
  <p>Halesowen recovered from this pressure as Cowley went close on 82 minutes after excellent work on the edge of the box.The resulting corner was headed goalwards by substitute Chris Smith which the keeper did well to save.</p>
  <p>Halesowen held on in the 3 minutes of injury time to get a deserved 3 points.</p>
