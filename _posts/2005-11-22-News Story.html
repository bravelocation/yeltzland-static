  <p>I guess many others share my lack of enthusiasm for the Senior Cups. A crowd of just 90 saw us lose to Willenhall 3-2 in the B'ham variety despite us twice being ahead from Nathan and The Pope. Oh well.</p>
  <p>More serious knockout action occurs on Saturday when we travel to Sutton Coldfireld in the Trophy. This is definitely a competition we want to do well in (with prize money available), so I'm hoping for a good performance to put us into the hat with the Conference teams.</p>
