<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz won through in the end to clinch an exciting tie with Conference side Tamworth, although it wasn't as easy as the scoreline might suggest (according to  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=06122005">Dave's match report</a> ). Goals from Fozzy, Nathan and The Pope took us through to the First Round Proper on December 17th.</p>
  <p>A little more on the board restructuring - as far as I can tell the number of directors has been reduced to hopefully attract further investors. The old directors are still going to be involved in running the club, so in reality it shouldn't make any difference and hopefully we may get other people coming in to help out Nigel and the other directors financially. All seems pretty reasonable I think.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we travel to bottom placed  <a href="http://www.northwoodfc.com/">Northwood</a>  in a game we must be hopeful of winning. However they beat Merthyr away last week so their no mugs. I'll be making a rare visit but with Frank over from Spain please blame him if it all goes wrong.</p>

  <p>Halesowen booked an attractive tie against Conference giant-killers Tamworth in the next round after riding their early luck to record a flattering scoreline.</p>
  <p>The Royals dominated the first half but failed to take advantage of a string of good chances and finally succumbed after being reduced to nine men in the latter stages.</p>
  <p>The Royals dominated the first half but failed to take advantage of a string of good chances and finally succumbed after being reduced to nine men in the latter stages.</p>
  <p>Halesowen eventually sprung into life in the 17th minute when Nathan Lamey beat the offside trap but he lobbed the good chance over the bar from Dave Haywood's long ball.</p>
  <p>A through ball from Liam Hebberd carved open Halesowen yet again after 21 minutes but Markman screwed just wide. Goalkeeper Dean Coleman then collected the ball on the half-hour after a spell of ping-pong in the home area and saved from Hood a minute later for fortunate Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Alex Cowley beat off a couple of challenges to shoot wide from 15 yards in the 33rd minute and seconds later Simon Forsdick skipped down the wing before blasting high. But yet another chance went begging for the visitors after 36 minutes when Coleman lost the ball but recovered to save from Markman and force a corner.</p>
  <p>Sutton paid the price for failing to capitalise when Lamey's clever touch set up FORSDICK to bury a 10-yard volley two minutes before the interval to give Halesowen a lead they hardly deserved.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's performance showed no improvement after the interval as they continued to struggle to control the game against their lower league opposition. Nevertheless, two more goals were added from just three second-half attempts on goal after frustrated Sutton twice saw red.</p>
  <p>Nick Smith volleyed straight at Belford after 47 minutes and five minutes later Hebberd's cross was marginally too high for his supporting forwards at the other end.</p>
  <p>A dreary second period came to life when Sutton were reduced to ten men when Lucan Spittle committed two yellow card offences within three minutes by hacking down Lamey on the hour and then making a clumsy lunge at Howard Forinton.</p>
  <p>Halesowen went on to add a second goal in the 76th minute when Forinton set Forsdick free down the left and his cross picked out LAMEY to comfortably hit the net from 5 yards.</p>
  <p>Worse followed for Sutton when Haywood's long ball found Lamey and his legs were taken by Hood who anticipated his punishment by immediately walking off the field without waiting for his inevitable red card. Steve POPE stepped up to smash home the resulting 84th minute penalty and put Halesowen into the next round at home to Tamworth on Saturday 17th December.</p>
