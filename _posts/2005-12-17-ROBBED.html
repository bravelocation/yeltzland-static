    Maybe a bit harsh, but an excellent battling Yeltz performance was marred by a strange goal that looked very dodgy from 80 yards away through blue contact lenses. It's a shame the referee spolit what was an excellent cup tie, and one that we probably deserved to get at least a draw. A more considered view - including quotes from the two managers - from Dave in his  :-)

  <p>On Tuesday we play our last game before Xmas in the Errea Cup (the League Cup) at Banbury. The winner will be decided on the night, and will be at home to Rushall in the last 16, so we've got half a chance of having a decent run.</p>
  <p>BTW in case you were wondering it's definitely not me who is the jinx as I was on the phone to Frank when they equalised, so that makes it definitely him. Thankfully I won't be at a game until New Year's Eve so the theory can't be tested any more.</p>

  <p>Sponsors' Man of the Match: Howard Forinton   NLP Man of the Match: Alex Cowley</p>
  <p>Halesowen took an early lead but were denied a deserved replay and bowed out of the Trophy when Nationwide Conference Tamworth poked home a controversial, sloppy late winner.</p>
  <p>Manager Paul Holleran claimed that "Dean Coleman had both hands on the ball and Eddie Anaclet got away with a cheeky toe-poke" as he highlighted a number of refereeing decisions against the Yeltz. In contrast, opposing manager Mark Cooper felt that "Coleman spilled the ball before Anaclet tapped home".</p>
  <p>The lower league Yeltz were far from over-awed and made a fine start as tricky winger Alex Cowley bamboozled three defenders down the right in the 6th minute only for Simon Forsdick to mis-hit the resulting cross.</p>
  <p>FA Cup giant-killers Tamworth were given a shock taste of their own medicine in the 7th minute when an excellent flick from Howard Forinton set Nathan LAMEY free and he ran on 35 yards, holding off two chasing defenders before beating Scott Bevan with a fine finish from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>But Halesowen's lead was short-lived as the Lambs levelled just two minutes later when Graham WARD curled a direct free-kick past the defensive wall beyond static goalkeeper Coleman into the corner of the net after Gary Knight needlessly fouled Nathan Jackson on the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>Nick Amos then headed Dave Haywood's 13th minute free-kick wide and giant goalkeeper Bevan lost Cowley's 20th minute cross but Bevan recovered to collect a 25-yard shot from Forinton seconds later.</p>
  <p>Jake Edwards received the first of the afternoon's many bookings for a nasty 21st minute elbow on Nicki Preston from referee Mr Lewis, who famously ran the line at Old Trafford last season when Spurs were denied what appeared a clear 'goal'.</p>
  <p>With Matt Redmile and Carl Heggs suspended, Tamworth gave a debut to new signing Alan Neilson, formerly of Newcastle United and in a good spell for the visitors, Forsdick cleared Jackson's 27th minute cross at the second attempt. Two minutes later Halesowen had another let-off when young Coleman failed to communicate with his defence but the ball trickled just past the post. Steve Melton's drive on the half-hour was deflected wide and four minutes later hesitant Coleman allowed Dave Bampton to head Carl Motteram's cross wide.</p>
  <p>Just before the interval Halesowen broke away with Forsdick setting Cowley free but Bevan was down quickly to save the 15-yard shot. Cowley then challenged in midfield and the ball fell kindly to Lamey, but he dragged a shot wide from the edge of the area with Forinton available in support.</p>
  <p>The hosts continued to compete well in a hard-fought second-half. Cowley's 49th minute free-kick was turned away with Bevan easily gathering Forinton's header from the resulting corner.  Bevan then punched clear from Nick Amos with Steve Pope just unable to connect with the rebound under pressure. A clever 55th minute move saw Forsdick play a return pass to Forinton but his shot was blocked for a corner and Cowley delivered a delightful free-kick into the Tamworth penalty area after 63 minutes but the ball was again hacked clear.</p>
  <p>Melton did hit the net for Tamworth in the 65th minute but his effort was disallowed for a push on Pope. Cowley limped off after 67 minutes and a minute later Coleman dithered once more but the ball was put away for a corner. Pope also limped out of the action with Preston taking over the captain's arm-band on 72 minutes.</p>
  <p>A remarkable total of six yellow cards were dished out to Halesowen in the final fifteen minutes, almost certainly leading to a disciplinary fine. With a replay looking on the cards, a good afternoon's work from Halesowen then also went wrong with Tamworth's costly, soft, late winner.</p>
  <p>An 80th minute right-wing cross went over Knight but bounced back harmlessly off substitute Stuart Pierpoint's shin to Coleman, yet the ball then inexplicably ended up in the Halesowen net. Some called it a goal-keeping gaffe with the ball slipping from Coleman's grasp, while others were looking for a free-kick against Eddie Anaclet for kicking the ball from the goalkeeper's hands. In reality, although Coleman initially had the ball under control with both hands, on-loan Southampton wide-man Eddie ANACLET took his chance to nip in and poke the ball home with Coleman failing to lay sufficient claim to a ball that slipped from his fingers.</p>
  <p>Three minutes from full-time Coleman make a splendid reflex save to deny Anaclet again with the ball rolling just past the post.</p>
