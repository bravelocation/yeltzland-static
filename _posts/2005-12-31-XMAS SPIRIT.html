title: XMAS SPIRIT
match: Yeltz 1 Gloucester 0 and Yeltz 2 Bath City 1
---

<p>
  <p>Two narrow victories at The Grove over the holiday period meant the mighty Yeltz go into 2006 in a little better spirits (let's not go overboard here). A 1-0 win over Gloucester was followed by a 2-1 defeat of Bath City - and yes I was there for the Bath game (and I even saw Howard's very early goal!). Full details as ever in Dave's match reports.</p>
  <p>We complete our holiday fixtures today (Monday) when we travel to Merthyr. It's important we keep our good run going if we are going to keep our promotion hopes realistic. We won there last year but it's always a tough place to visit and they're in decent form so a point would be reasonable I reckon.</p>
  <p>I'm back from my travels now so the site should be back to normal service - let's hope for a successful 2006!</p>
