title: INTO THE FINAL
match: WSC SF  Yeltz 4 Sutton Coldfield 1
---

<p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz progressed into the final of the mighty Worcestershire Senior Cup with a 4-1 thumping of Sutton Coldfield. Two goals from Nathan, one from Howard  and a first ever goal for us from the mighty Chris Smith put us through to play either Worcester or Moor Green.</p>
  <p>We're back in league action on Saturday when struggling Aylesbury visit The Grove. We're a long way off any chance of promotion, but I reckon 10 wins and 2 draws (the games at Salisbury and Chips'n'Ham) should do it easily. Positive vibes never harmed us, so let's not give up just yet - we can still do it.</p>

  <p>Cup holders Halesowen cruised into their third Worcestershire Senior Cup final in the last four years to meet the winners of the Worcester City v Moor Green tie scheduled for Monday, 27th February.</p>
  <p>Niki Preston's 4th minute long ball found Nathan Lamey on the right and he prodded just wide of advancing goalkeeper Dale Belford. Home goalkeeper Dean Coleman then hit a 6th minute clearance straight at Liam Hebberd but the ball fell kindly into safety. On 15 minutes Coleman saved from Adam Cooper after the Royals won a corner but Halesowen broke straight up-field with Forinton being denied by Belford racing out of his penalty area. At the other end, Stuart Pierpoint made a superb 19th minute challenge to intercept Damien Markman who was clear on goal. Sutton then won their fifth corner of the evening on the half-hour and two minutes later Owen struck a 20-yard free-kick just past the post.</p>
  <p>But the Yeltz killed the game with two goals just before half-time and took the lead after 38 minutes when Howard FORINTON latched onto a long ball before skipping past Belford to slot home. Belford made a fabulous double save in the 43rd minute to keep out Nick Smith's 18-yard shot and denied Nick Smith again as Simon Forsdick turned the ball back across goal. But Nick Smith then selflessly played Pierpoint's cross on for LAMEY to tap home the second Halesowen goal in the 44th minute.</p>
  <p>At the start of the second period Belford saved Lamey's header at his post fro Forinton's cross. LAMEY then showed his strength to shrug off a challenge before planting his second goal into the corner of the net from ten yards to make it 3-0 in the 49th minute.</p>
  <p>Coleman made a fine save to deny Hebberd in front of goal on the hour but with Halesowen looking for more goals substitute Alex Cowley's drive was touched just past the post by Forinton on the hour. Cowley then set up Nick Smith to strike just wide on the overlap two minutes later.</p>
  <p>Daniel McGEE pulled back a consolation goal for the visitors in the 75th minute when his left-wing cross deceived Coleman to drop into the corner of the net.</p>
  <p>Forsdick's 84th minute cross was flicked onto the post by substitute Chris Smith but Chris Smith went on to score his first ever Halesowen goal with two minutes remaining when he ran clear to beat Belford after winning a midfield challenge on the final defender.</p>
