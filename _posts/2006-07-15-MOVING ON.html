  <p>I've been at this for 9 years now, and finally time, energy and the fact that I don't get to see the mighty Yeltz much nowadays means I've decided to more or less stop doing Yeltzland any more.</p>
  <p>
    The main reason for the site coming into existance was to make sure Yeltz fans had somewhere where they could find out information about what was going on, and somewhere to voice their own opinions. We now have the excellent  for the news part, and to replace Yeltz Talk I've set up a new forum at  where we can carry on sharing information etc.
    
  </p>
  <p>Also please note I'm not giving up on supporting the club in any way whatsoever. I'll probably post more on the new forum than I did here (although I'll have to stop putting sarky comments in red I suppose!), and I'll still be getting to as many games as I can.</p>
  <p>I'll hopefully see lots of you in a couple of weeks at the Kiddy friendly (Frank's sort of 40th weekend), and if not sometime in the new season.</p>
