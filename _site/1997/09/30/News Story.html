        <p>The Yeltz march on in the FA Cup, winning the replay against Rothwell 4-1 after extra time. It was 1-1 at full-time, Halesowen having taken the lead through Kevin Harrison. However Rothwell had their goalie sent off, and by the end were down to 9 men. Goals from Gardiner, Piearce and Yates means we go through to a home tie against Redditch.</p>
