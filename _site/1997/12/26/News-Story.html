  <p>Another late goal - this time an Evran volley - gained The Yeltz a well-deserved draw &#xD;
against Bromsgrove.</p>
  <p>We took the lead through Luke Yates early on, but they equalised before half-time.&#xD;
Bromsgrove then took the lead in dubious circumstances, when Carter used his hand to set up the goal. Unfortunately the referee didn't see anything wrong and despite vehement protests from players and fans alike, the goal stood with Paul Harding being sent off for dissent.</p>
  <p>However justice (of sorts) was done when Evran volleyed home a Pie-arce header nine minutes from time. Phew!</p>
