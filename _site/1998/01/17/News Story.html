  <p>Our first loss in 11 games in the league - 1-2 away to Nuneaton - partly due to some poor finishing and partly due to a ridiculous ref.</p>
  <p>I guess a draw would have been a fair result. It was an excellent game in which we always looked dangerous going forward. They took the lead halfway through the second-half, and we equalised through an Evran header.</p>
  <p>Then in injury time Woody got sent off for a second booking, although from where I was standing (admittedly 80 yards away) it looked harsh. They then went and nicked a winner and  Stewart had a quiet few words with the ref after the game.</p>
