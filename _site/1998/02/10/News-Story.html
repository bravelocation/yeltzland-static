        <h3>10 February 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Our only away win in the league (so far?) came there, and now The Yeltz stormed into the quarter-finals of the B'ham Senior Cup with an exciting win on penalties against Tamworth.</p>
  <p>We twice came from behind to force extra-time with goals from Crisp and Piearce - the latter in injury time - and won 3-2 on penalties with goals from Kevin, Pie-arce and Crisp (Snapper missed his). We're away to Paget in the quarters.</p>
