        <h2>Yeltz 3 Nuneaton 0</h2>
        <h3>21 February 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>I'm going to keep saying it - that's three wins on the trot now, as the Yeltz overpowered Nuneaton 3-0 in another excellent performance. Goals from Cooper, Evans (also named man of the match by the FYI Jolly Boys - we were sponsoring the match) and a penalty by Crispy.</p>
  <p>I'd like to take time to thank the club for their hospitality yesterday; it was a bit strange watching from the Harry Rudge Stand, and I think that's why Evo won MOTM, as for once we could actually see what our defenders do!</p>
