        <h3>03 March 1998</h3>
        
        <p>What a wheeze! The Yeltz cleverly decided to let Paget get a 1-1 draw in the B'ham Senior Cup knowing that, because their neighbours are afraid of their floodlights, they'll have to return to The Grove for a money-spinning replay. Halesowen's scorer was Evran, and the crowd was a mighty 302.</p>
