    Hopes were high after we stuffed them last year, but despite probably deserving more we once again lost to Kiddy 1-0 in the insignificantWorcester Senior Cup.
    
  </p>
  <p>We missed quite a few chances, and ex-Yeltzman Darren Steadman should have been sent off when handballing outside the area to stop Steve Pie-arce, but that's two games without scoring now, and we haven't won in four.</p>
