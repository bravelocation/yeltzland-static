        <h3>21 March 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Another victory (3-1) against a team who look like they're going down. Goals from Evran, Crispy and Evans means that Bromsgrove are stuck in the bottom four, whereas we're back up to 3rd place.</p>
  <p>
    After a few decent seasons in the Conference, Bromsgrove are now looking like doing a Stafford Rangers and dropping straight through. It makes you wonder whether it's worth going up.
    
  </p>
  <p>At the top, it's all pretty close again with Merthyr only drawing at Rothwell and Forest Green winning at Hastings.</p>
