        <h2>Sittingbourne 0 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>04 April 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>On an extremely blustery day at Sittingbourne's oversized and ridiculously named Central Park, Yeltz keeper Danny McDonnell made two - yes two - penalty saves to earn Halesowen a point in a 0-0 draw.</p>
  <p>It was a pretty nondescript game really, with the wind making it very difficult to play. Stewart managed to get sent off for disputing the penalty decisions - he had a point from our vantage point of 150 yards away - and we had a couple of shots without hitting the target.</p>
  <p>It's all square at the top between Merthyr and Forest Green. Both teams' grounds have been passed for promotion, but Merthyr have initially been refused as they were notionally reformed in the summer after financial problems. They're hoping to appeal, and let's hope that whoever tops the table is the team to go up.</p>
  <p>In the morning, the Jolly Boys supporter's team inflicted the first ever defeat on Sittingbourne supporters with an exciting 4-3 victory. Once again thanks to Sittingbourne for their excellent hospitality, and maybe we'll be able to play them again next season if they can stay up.</p>
