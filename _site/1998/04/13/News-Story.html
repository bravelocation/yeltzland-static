        <h2>Worcester 1 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>13 April 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The statisticians have spoken - there's now no possible way we can go up, even with the most unlikely combination of results and some jobs-worth ground graders. A 1-1 draw against Worcester (scorer E. Wright) has left us in 6th place with the best we can now do is 3rd.</p>
  <p>In the big game, Merthyr stuffed Forest Green 4-0 to go a point above them. We now go down to the woods on Saturday in a game that's a lot more important for them than for us.</p>
