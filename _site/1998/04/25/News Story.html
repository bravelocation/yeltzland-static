  <p>A disappointing 1-0 loss against Crawley, but I guess there's really nothing to play for. Not a lot to be said really.</p>
  <p>It's a big week coming up with the last three games of the season - our first final in many years on Tuesday in the B'ham Senior Cup against Redditch, then the last two league games, at home to Bath on Thursday and then down to Hastings on Saturday - usual fancy dress applies.</p>
  <p>There's also the huge charity game - Halesowen Jolly Boys supporters vs. Radio WM All-Stars (or something like that) at The Grove tomorrow (Sunday). Unfortunately your editor can't make the game, but he's already scored on the hallowed turf last time we played there so he's not too bothered :-)</p>
  <p>The latest on the talk of creating a Conference Division Two - Friday's Times said the Conference are going ahead with their application to the FA to create the new division. There should be a decision made by June 6, and if successful it will be in place for the 1999-2000 season.</p>
