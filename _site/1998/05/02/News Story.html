    And it's all over again. A 2-2 draw at Hastings, but with <b>the anointed one</b> gettting a late equaliser - it doesn't get much better than that
    
  </p>
  <p>I guess it was a 7 out of 10 sort of season. We finished 5th in the end, but except for a short time around January, we never really looked like challenging. We did <b>win the B'ham Senior Cup</b> though. Talking to Stewart after the game, we can expect a few new faces next season, and the release of some of the current squad. Roll on August.</p>
  <p> <b>Forest Green</b> clinched the title by beating Bath 2-0 and so move up to the Conference. St. Leonards, Ashford and Sittingbourne will be replaced by Grantham, Ilkeston and Weymouth, but it looks like Bromsgrove may be saved as Chelmsford's facilities aren't up to standard.</p>
