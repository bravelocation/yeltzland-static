  <H3>TRANSFERS</H3>
  <p>I guess we hadn't thought through the effects of the Bosman ruling. The summer started with the shock departure of <b>Snapper</b> to Hereford. He wanted Conference football, we couldn't give it to him so he left. I think it was difficult for him, and it sure was for us.</p>
  <p> <b>Stuart Evans</b> also left for Hereford, <b>Jason Owen</b> 's gone to Stafford, and <b>Evran</b> gone for his summer holidays to Worcester - we're expecting him back any day now. <b>Kevin Harrison</b> 's arthritic knee has meant he's had to call it a day, and <b>Sharpey</b> has been released.</p>
  <p>Luckily, Stewart has been busy getting in some replacements. <b>Tim Langford</b> is back from Telford, and <b>Neil Smith</b> , ex-Rushden but actually from Halesowen has also signed. Two more from Bromsgrove have arrived - <b>Mark Peters</b> , a midfielder and <b>Rob Elmes</b> , a defender. Finally, we've signed <b>Simon Black</b> , a forward who used to play with Pie-arce at Doncaster before he got glandular fever.</p>
  <p>We started with our traditional opener against the Albion. After we beat them a few years ago, they usually put a decent team out now, and we lost 4-0. Next was a 2-1 win at Oldbury, then 0-0 draws in Andy Bradley's testimonial against old rivals Hednesford and against Sandwell Borough. An excellent 1-0 stuffing of Stourbridge, a 3-1 win over Stourport and a 2-0 loss against Blakenall completed the warm-up.</p>
