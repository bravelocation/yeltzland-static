        <h2>Kings Lynn 1 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>29 August 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>After failing in the mountains of Gresley, The Yeltz got an improved result - if not performance - back at sea level in the flatlands of King's Lynn.</p>
  <p>
    They'd lost their first two games and to be honest were terrible. We gifted them a goal early on when Woody was caught dawd-lynnon the ball by their giant centre-forward, who then couldn't miss. We dominated from then on without really looking convincing. There was a couple of scrambles and Pie-arce hit the bar with a header before we finally equalised late on.

  <p>A brilliant free-kick from young Birch could only be pushed out by the Lynn keeper into the path of Ian Reed, who smacked it in with relish. I'll maybe write a full report later, but as usual don't hold your breath :-)</p>
