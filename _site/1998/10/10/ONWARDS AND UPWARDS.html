        <h2>Yeltz 5 Grantham 1</h2>
        <h3>10 October 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Another excellent result - a 5-1 stuffing of newly promoted Grantham at The Grove.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz took the lead in the first half with a couple of goals from Reedy and Lord Bradley. They then pulled one back which left it 2-1 at half-time. Delton Francis, in what could be his last performance as his loan period is now finished, then scored two more and Simon Black got one late on. Excellent!</p>
