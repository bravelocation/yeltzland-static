  <p>Well I suppose it was exciting but we're out of the FA Cup for another year, losing 2-1 to Gresley at The Grove.</p>
  <p>The weather played a big part in the game, and we got to half-time 0-0 playing more or less into the gale. Then <a href="/stuff/bradleyshrine.asp">Lord Bradley</a> scored with an over-the-shoulder volley after their pony-tailed goalie had fumbled a cross. We were all over them for a while, with Matt Gardiner coming close from 40 yards (it was windy) and Rob Elmes hitting the bar with what would have been goal of the century.</p>
  <p>The trouble was Gresley are a good team and eventually they equalised and then took the lead in the 87th minute from a couple of corners. Even then we had chances to equalise as the ref played an age of injury time but it wasn't to be.</p>
