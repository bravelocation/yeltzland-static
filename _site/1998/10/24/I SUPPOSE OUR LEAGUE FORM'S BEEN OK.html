  <p>Yet another disappointing Cup defeat - this time losing 2-0 at home to Guiseley in the FA Trophy. Goals halfway through each half clinched it for the visitors, but without Pie-arce up front (again) we hardly managed a shot.</p>
  <p>The good news is Delton Francis has signed from Hednesford for supposedly a five-figure fee and will be available for next weekend. Delton's done brilliant in his loan spell at The Grove, and should make an excellent partner for Pie-arce.</p>
  <p>We're finally back in league action on Saturday when we visit Rothwell. There's been some confusion about whether Rothwell are still in the FA Cup - the papers and Ceefax say they are, but the club assure us they aren't - so as far as we know, the match <b>is</b> on. For up-to-date information, your best bet is joining the Yeltz Mailing List .</p>
