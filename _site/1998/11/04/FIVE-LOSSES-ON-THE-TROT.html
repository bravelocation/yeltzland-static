        <h1>FIVE LOSSES ON THE TROT</h1>
        <h2>Boston 2 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>04 November 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Despite having close to a full strength side out, The Yeltz couldn't break out of their losing streak, going down 2-0 in a freezing Boston.</p>
  <p>We actually played pretty well without having any luck at all. We had the better of a quiet first half without really threatening. Then just after half time, one of their players collapsed in the box after what looked like an innocuous challenge and we were one down.</p>
  <p>From then on we were all over them, with their keeper making a fantastic save from Birch (my man of the match) and tipping a Del-boy 30-yard lob onto the bar. Then they scored a second completely against the run of play with a spectacular long-range shot, and the ridiculous Harding - for the love of God, just go - got sent off for dissent.</p>
  <p>Even down to ten men - or perhaps because of - we still outplayed Boston but couldn't even get a consolation. Stewart looked very miserable walking off, and there were rumours of emergency board meetings being held this week. Hmmm.</p>
