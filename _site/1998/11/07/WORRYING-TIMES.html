  <p>And it gets worse. Another very disappointing loss, this time 0-1 at home to lowly King's Lynn and we're in big trouble. We've now lost 6 on the trot and are just two points above the relegation zone, with most of the teams below us having games in hand.</p>
  <p>It's now pretty obvious that something is seriously wrong. Rumours of emergency board meetings must mean Stewart Hall's job is in jeopardy now. Personally I've always thought he's a brilliant manager, but I'm not sure how long the current slide can be allowed to continue without something being done.</p>
  <p>I'm sure we'll be discussing this on the  Yeltz Mailing List  this week, so if you've got anything to say on this (or any) subject, please feel free to join in.</p>
