  <p>Yeltz fans were greeted with the disappointing news that manager Stewart Hall has "resigned by mutual consent". After such a poor start to the season it wasn't completely unexpected as it was clear that something had to be done.</p>
  <p>Stewart's record in his four years in charge was excellent, taking us to our highest position ever in the non-league pyramid. Personally I found him a great bloke, always willing to chat about the game and interested in what you had to say.</p>
  <p>Colin Brookes is temporarily in charge, and his appointment brought an immediate upturn in fortunes with  <b>The Yeltz beating Bromsgrove 1-0 in the League Cup.</b>  A late goal from Paul Birch, a top corner screamer, finally broke the run of six defeats. Phew!</p>
