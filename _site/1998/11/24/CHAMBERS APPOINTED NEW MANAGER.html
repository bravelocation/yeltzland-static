        <h1>CHAMBERS APPOINTED NEW MANAGER</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>24 November 1998</h3>

  <p> <b>John Chambers</b> , ex-Stourbridge, Dudley, Kiddy... has been confirmed as  <b>new manager of The Yeltz</b> . I can't improve on Dave Johnson's description on the  Yeltz Mailing List , so I'll copy below what he said:</p>
  <p>
    "For those who don't know - John is currently with Willenhall from the Interlink Alliance. He has good local knowledge and his teams are always battlers. On the minus side, he's been operating in the lower leagues for quite a few seasons now, after being with Dudley beforehand and then apparently out of the game for a season, after Dudley crashed.&#xD;
 &#xD;
"He won the title with Stourbridge and many think he was instrumental in setting Kidderminster on their way before Graham Allner. However, on the disciplinary side, I remember him being sent off at The Grove and chasing Sean Flynn around the pitch, with the general idea of causing him some health problems. Fortunately, Flynnie was far too quick for him.&#xD;
 &#xD;
"Also, I believe John was close to getting the job when Stewart was appointed, and was quite devastated not to get it. Having managed Dudley at The Grove, he is also familiar with the set up. I suspect our strategy would go back to pulling in local talent, rather than the more expensive ex-pros of recent signings. I suspect there will be an element of surprise at such an appointment though." Dave
