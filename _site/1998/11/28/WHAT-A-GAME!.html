        <h1>WHAT A GAME!</h1>
        <h2>Nuneaton 4 Yeltz 3</h2>
        <h3>28 November 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Where 7 minutes of injury-time came from I'll never know, but it was a very promising performance under new manager John Chambers.</p>
  <p>Such a lot happened in the game I haven't really got space to give the match justice. They took the lead early on from an easy header, and our pre-match half-joking predictions of 0-4 being a good result weren't looking so funny any more. Then  <b>Birchy curled a fantastic free-kick</b>  into the top corner and we were back in it.</p>
  <p>Then just before half-time we took a deserved lead following a  <b>brilliant break</b>  from defence - <b>Gardiner-&gt;Reed-&gt;Francis-&gt;Goal!</b> </p>
  <p>A penalty after 68 mins brought it back to 2-2, then  <b>Matt Gardiner was sent off</b>  for two bookings, the second for kicking the ball away after a foul. Piearce was sacrificed for an extra defender leaving Delton up front on his own, but Nuneaton were pressing so hard for a winner he looked really dangerous on the break. On one brilliant run he beat several players, rounded the keeper but his shot was scrambled off the line by the last defender.</p>
  <p>Then  <b>in the 90th minute Del-boy</b>  was free again and this time slotted it past the keeper to score what looked like a famous winner. Unfortunately the ref decided there was 7 minutes of injury-time to play, and in that time Nuneaton somehow managed first to equalise and then score a last-gasp winner.</p>
