        <h3>09 December 1998</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The Yeltz safely progressed through to the next round of the League Cup by beating Bromsgrove 2-1, 3-1 on aggregate.</p>
  <p>The game was delayed for a long time just after the kick-off when one of the Bromsgrove defenders unfortunately broke his leg. When the game was finally restarted, we flew at Bromsgrove and early goals from <b>Delton</b> and <b>Pie-arce</b> meant the tie was just about safe. We perhaps should have scored more, but despite a late consolation for Bromsgrove we ran out easy winners.</p>
