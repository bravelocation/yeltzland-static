        <h1>YELTZ EARN POINT IN STORM</h1>
        <h2>Grantham 0 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>02 January 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>After the heroics against Nuneaton, <b>a weary Yeltz ground out a hard-fought 0-0 draw against lumbering Grantham</b> .</p>
  <p>It was <b>our first visit to Grantham's new(ish) out-of-town stadium, a horrible affair</b> with a running track and a couple of character-less concrete stands on each side. <b>A strong wind</b> blowing straight down the boggy pitch <b>hindered</b> any attempts at playing good football, and to be honest <b>not a lot happened</b> . They were a big team without much skill, and we battled hard without really threatening.</p>
  <p>At the end of <b>a productive holiday period</b> (I think we'd have been happy with 7 points beforehand, although probably would have expected to gain them in a different manner), <b>we've climbed up to 12th place in the table</b> , although this could have changed after this afternoon's (Sunday's) games.</p>
  <p>It's very close except at the very top and the very bottom. <b>The good news</b> is we're only 7 points behind 2nd-placed Boston - <b>the bad news</b> is we're only 5 points above the relegation zone and every one below us has got games in hand.</p>
