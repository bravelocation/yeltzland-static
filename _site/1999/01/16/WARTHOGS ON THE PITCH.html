  <p>The <b>bad weather</b> meant we cleverly made several of our relegation rivals use up one of their games in hand as <b>our game against Ilkeston was called off</b> . We haven't got a game next week either, so things should be a bit clearer by the time <b>Gloucester visit The Grove on the 30th</b> .</p>
  <p>We've slipped a place in the table to 14th, and are only (gulp) <b>3 points above the relegation zone</b> . Makes the rest of the season interesting I suppose.</p>
