  <p>Welcome to the new, slightly more exciting world of <b>www.yeltzland.net</b> . I hope you found it OK - I won't be updating the old site any more so if you could <b>update your bookmarks, links</b> etc. to here now I'd be much obliged.</p>
  <p>Moving the site means I can now add interactive content - for example, check out the greatly expanded <b> <a href="/anorak/default.asp">Anorak Corner</a> </b> for <b>loads more stats</b> than you could possibly be interested in.</p>
  <p>There's also <b> <a href="/haveyoursay/fantasyisland/default.asp">Fantasy Island</a> </b> where you can compete against the world in showing you can <b>predict how the mighty Yeltz will do</b> in their battle for survival.</p>
  <p>On a footballing front, we've been <b>inactive for ages</b> which unfortunately means several teams have used some of their games in hand to go above us. We're now <b>17th in the  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=25011999">table</a> </b> , and in big trouble.</p>
  <p>On the positive side, <b>Paul Harding has been put on the transfer list</b> . Grattan are favourites to sign him.</p>
