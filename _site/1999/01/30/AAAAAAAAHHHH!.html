        <h2>Yeltz 0 Gloucester 1</h2>
        <h3>30 January 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>A rusty-looking Yeltz dropped to only <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=30011999">one place above the relegation zone</a> </b> with a very depressing 1-0 loss at home to Glouceter.</p>
  <p>You might have thought the long break would have left us <b>raring to go</b> , but on a very cut up pitch - what price having other teams pay us to ruin the pitch if we go down? - <b>we struggled to get anything going</b> .</p>
  <p>They had one very successful tactic; give it to their <b>big center-forward</b> and let him run at our defence. &#xD;
The only plan we had was to <b>hack him down</b> , but unfortunately (and pretty obviously) all this led to was 3 bookings and a <b>penalty</b> .</p>
  <p>We tried hard in the second half, and did manage to hit the bar (with the ball, not at half-time). However even with <b>Pie-arce</b> coming on (not looking fully recovered) and nearly sneaking one, we never really threatened their keeper. <b>Very disappointing</b> .</p>
