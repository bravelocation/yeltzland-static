  <p>I've had enough now. It's desperation time after another loss in the League, so it's time to get out your <b>lucky pants</b> , good-luck charms, whatever... the line HAS been drawn - <b>this is where the fight back begins</b> .</p>
  <p>This is not the time to start blaming anyone. OK since <b>John Chambers</b> has come in we've only <b>won twice</b> in the league, and one of those was against <b>hapless Bromsgrove</b> . The other, as we all remember, was against runaway leaders <b>Nuneaton</b> so we know we CAN do it.</p>
  <p>The only part we can play is to try and get behind the team as much as possible. I know everyone is bewildered and a little upset about how things are going, but there'll be plenty of time for recrimination in the summer if we do go down.</p>
  <p> <b>COME ON!</b> </p>
