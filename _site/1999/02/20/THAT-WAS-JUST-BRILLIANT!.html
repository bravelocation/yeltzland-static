        <h1>THAT WAS JUST BRILLIANT!</h1>
        <h2>Salisbury 1 Yeltz 2</h2>
        <h3>20 February 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>In one of the tensest games for many a while, <b>The Mighty Yeltz</b> battled to a brilliant victory against a Salisbury team that had previously gone 12 games unbeaten.</p>
  <p>Out in the Wiltshire countryside, a <b>strong wind</b> was blowing straight down the pitch and we took full advantage playing with it in the first half. Steve <b>Piearce</b> scored the first when he poked out a foot and looped the ball over the keeper at the end of a fine move.</p>
  <p>We then went further ahead when young <b>Birch</b> scuttled after a long ball down the left, put over a briiliant cross to <b>Elmes</b> , who headed it past the keeper for his first ever goal - although <b>Pie-arce</b> followed in to make sure to <b>technically claim the goal</b> .</p>
  <p>When we turned around for the <b>second half</b> , we knew we were in for a battle when <b>they scored early on</b> , and it was unbearably exciting as Salisbury chased the equaliser, and we tried to hit them on the break. Rob <b>Elmes ran himself to a standstill</b> - although only one person in the whole ground knows <b>why he wasn't substituted earlier</b> - and Piearce and Birchy played particularly well.</p>
  <p>Then they put a header over the bar from a what looked like a yard out, I'd won the sweep and my <b>lucky socks</b> had done the business again. Hurrah!</p>
