        <p>
  <p>The <b>promotion race continues</b> as another <b>Yeltz victory</b> means we can still catch leaders Nuneaton - with 10 games to go <b>we're only 29 points behind</b> them in <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=06031999">a remarkable  <b>8th place</b> </a> .</p>
  <p>It's actually quite nice to even bother to <b>look up the table</b> , but a fourth consecutive victory has hopefully easied our relegation worries a little.</p>
  <p>After a goalless first half, we took the lead with a goal from (who else) <b>Steve Pie-arce</b> , and then added a second from <b>Reedy</b> . Dorchester pulled one back soon after, but then <b>Stevo</b> got his <b>9th in four games</b> and we'd won again.</p>
