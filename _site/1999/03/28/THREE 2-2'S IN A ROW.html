        <h1>THREE 2-2'S IN A ROW</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 2 Bath 2</h2>
        <h3>28 March 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Another game, <b>another 2-2 draw</b> and another point nearer safety. It all sounds a bit <b>boring</b> , but watching the mighty Yeltz is <b>anything but that</b> at the moment, with brilliant attacking being cancelled out by some less than brilliant defending.</p>
  <p>We started off like the proverbial train, so it was inevitable when they took the lead <b>completely against the run of play</b> through the superbly-named <b>Fidell</b> Richards. Thankfully we finally equalised just before the break when <b>super-striker Rob Elmes</b> was left unmarked to nod in a Neil Smith cross.</p>
  <p>The second-half was more of the same; we piled forward, hitting the post, blazing it over, some mad scrambles, <b>going behind again</b> and then getting a <b>late equaliser</b> when <b>Stevo smashed in a shot</b> from the edge of the box into the roof of the net.</p>
  <p>I'm off on me hols for a few days over Easter, so the site may be a bit out of date (no news there then), but I'll <b>do what I can</b> .</p>
