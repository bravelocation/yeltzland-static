  <p>The Mighty Yeltz extended their unbeaten run to <b>10 games</b> with a scrappy victory over doomed (hopefully) Cambridge.</p>
  <p>As the Jolly Boys were <b>sponsoring the game</b> (in honour of it being Sean's last game before moving to Barcelona) we were watching from the <b>seats</b> . This was a <b>frightening</b> experience as:</p>
  <p>This meant we had an excellent view of Lloydy barging the <b>Cambridge</b> forward over to concede a penalty which meant they <b>took an early lead</b> . We didn't really do much after that but finally equalised when somehow <b>Matt Gardiner</b> found himself in front of goal to knock in a rebound from the keeper.</p>
  <p>The second half was pretty dire; they were happy to launch any possesion as long as possible, and we simply did nothing. However, we clinched another three points when <b>Ralphy Crisp</b> hit a scorcher into the top corner - although the best bit was his delayed celebrations when he <b>didn't know he'd scored</b> .</p>
  <p>Thanks to the club for everything yesterday, and once again good luck to Sean in his new life in Spain.</p>
