        <h1>GOING OUT IN STYLE</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 3 Hastings 3</h2>
        <h3>24 April 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The last home game of the season brought another goal-feast to The Grove, a <b>3-3 draw with Hastings</b> featuring yet another <b>Steve Piearce hat-trick</b> (the 4th in 2 months). He's now got an unbelievable <b>30 goals</b> (we've decided to give him the one on Boxing Day) this season despite the fact he was injured for long spells throughout. <b>Please stay Stevo</b> .</p>
  <p>We took the lead just before half-time, but were soon down 2-1 after the break. They replied to Stevo's 2nd almost straight afterwards, and it took an <b>injury-time equaliser</b> for us to gain a point.</p>
  <p>If you didn't know already, the theme for the <b>fancy dress</b> next week at Atherstone is <b>pop-stars</b> - mainly because the Jolly Boys (who've always been known for their great style and taste) have hired <b>several limos</b> for the day.</p>
  <p>It should be a brilliant day, with the added bonus of an extremely <b>exciting conclusion to the  <a href="/haveyoursay/fantasyisland/">Fantasy Island</a>  competition.</b> </p>
