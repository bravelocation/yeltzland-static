  <p>It's only a week into the close season and <b>things aren't looking good</b> already. The current situation is this:</p>
  <p>The <b>YTS team</b> have also been <b>disbanded</b> next season and any players remaining (hopefully we'll have at least 11) will be on <b>reduced wages</b> . Hmmm.</p>
  <p>On a brighter note, <b>Paul Birch</b> was <b>Supporters Player of the Year</b> , and <b>Crispy</b> was <b>Player's Player</b> .</p>
  <p>More news as I get it (and thanks to my sources for the above info!)</p>
