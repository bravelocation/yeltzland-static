        <h1>JOLLY BOYS  GOING "DOWN TO MARGATE"</h1>
        <h2></h2>

        <p>
  <p>Some good news for a change - <b>Margate</b> 's appeal to the FA has been accepted and they <b>will be promoted</b> next season <b>to replace hapless Cambridge City</b> .</p>
  <p>So the Jolly Boys will be off on a pilgrimage to their spiritual home instead of coming over to Cambridge to pester me into entertaining them. Hurrrrrraaaaaaaaaaah!</p>
  <p>Latest transfer news is that <b>Snapper</b> briefly came available when Hereford released him, but then he stupidly went and <b>signed for Nuneaton</b> . Also, ex-Yeltz manager <b>Johnny Morris</b> has become the new manager of <b>Oldbury United</b> .</p>
  <p>I've had yet <b>another message from a player</b> on the guestbook - this time from <b>Mark Peters</b> that you might find interesting.</p>
