        <h2></h2>
        <h3>12 June 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>After a long list of outgoing transfers, it nice to be able to report we've started the process of rebuilding for next season.</p>
  <p>First in is <b>Gary Piggott</b> , ex-Dudley and Albion <b>striker</b> . Despite being around for what seems like ages he's only 30 and a proven goal-scorer.</p>
  <p>Next is <b>Darren Wright</b> , who's played for loads of teams including Cheltenham when they got promoted a couple of seasons ago. He's a <b>midfielder</b> .</p>
  <p>Rumour has it Mr Chambers is due to make more signings soon - news here as soon as I hear anything.</p>
  <p>On a sad note, <b>Evran has finally been jailed</b> for supplying cannabis, but his sentence is only 9 months which leaves open the possibility we might still see old Supermop back playing down The Grove.</p>
