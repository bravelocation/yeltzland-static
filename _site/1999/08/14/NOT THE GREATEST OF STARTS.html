  <p>Very disappointing. After a reasonably promising run of pre-season friendlies, The Yeltz got off to a <b>dismal start</b> in the real stuff, <b>going down 1-0</b> at The Grove to <b>Dorchester</b> .</p>
  <p>In an uninspiring match, the only goal of the game was <b>a penalty</b> early in the second half to the visitors. Not what we were looking for but it's early days yet so <b>let's not get too downhearted</b> .</p>
  <p>Old news now but if you haven't heard, we've signed <b>ex-Northern Ireland international Rob Dennison</b> - for a bit anyway. Let's hope he's as successful as his old Wolves teammate Paul Birch has been.</p>
  <p>Anyway I'm back from me hols now so hopefully the site will be a bit more up-to-date than it has been of late :-)</p>
