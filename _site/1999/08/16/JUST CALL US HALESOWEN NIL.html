  <p>Two games gone and the Yeltz faithful are <b>still waiting their first goal</b> . At least we <b>gained a point</b> this time <b>away at</b> last season's 3rd placed <b>Ilkeston</b> so it's not too bad I suppose.</p>
  <p>We all knew we were going to miss Steve Piearce's goals but hopefully it won't be <b>too long</b> before our all-new strike force sparks into action. Hmmm.</p>
  <p>Anyway, I thought you'd like a picture of us <b>actually having a shot</b> on Saturday (courtesy of DJ Yeltz), but I didn't want too make it too big in case you got too excited.</p>
  <p>We're now off to <b>Salisbury on Saturday</b> - we must score soon mustn't we?</p>
