        <h1>WHAT A RELIEF!</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 2 Grantham 1</h2>
        <h3>24 August 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Finally! Three points, <b>a couple of goals</b> including a last minute winner and relief all round. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>A very <b>small crowd</b> (422) saw the Yeltz <b>go behind</b> early on to bottom-placed Grantham and things were looking very grim indeed. However second-half goals from <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b> and substitute <b>Robbie Dennison</b> meant we'd finally broken our duck for the season. We've now climbed to a slighly better <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=24081999">14th place</a> </b> in the table.</p>
  <p>One good thing that has come out of the <b>Halesowen News</b> fiasco is that <b>Yeltzland</b> has been asked to replace their <b>advert in the matchday programme</b> . The stunningly designed piece should be appearing on Saturday so look out for it. Thanks to Crip Crap for sorting that out.</p>
