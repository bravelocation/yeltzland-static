        <h2>Rothwell 2 Yeltz 2</h2>

  <p>Let's be <b>grateful for small mercies</b> . Two more goals and an away point aren't too bad, even if it was at perennial strugglers Rothwell.</p>
  <p>They took the lead just before half-time, but then <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b> turned in an Ashley Brown cross after the break. However, we were soon behind again when a free header made it 2-1 to Rothwell, but in the 72nd minute, after a Darren Wright piledriver from 25 yards hit the bar, <b>Ada Cooper</b> knocked in the rebound. (Thanks to DJ Grove for details)</p>
  <p>For a bit of fun I thought I'd trawl through <a href="/anorak/">Anorak Corner</a> and <b>compare our results last season</b> against the teams we've played so far:</p>
  <p>Not so bad when you look at it like that, and definitely helped by the fact that we <b>lost a  <a href="/news/default.asp?month=10&amp;year=1998#story31101998">horrible game at Rothwell</a>  last year</b> . OK, I'm clutching at straws but if enough of us believe this is a turning point it WILL be.</p>
