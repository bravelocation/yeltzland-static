        <h1>VERY POOR</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 0 Margate 3</h2>
        <h3>25 September 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>I can't remember if I've ever felt so <b>downbeat about our prospects</b> for the rest of the season. For as long as I've supported the Yeltz (over 17 years now) we've always had a pretty good side with the potential to win things. <b>I have no confidence</b> at all that the next 7 months aren't going to be <b>one long relegation battle</b> .</p>
  <p>I hoped that last week's FA Cup debacle would be the turning point, but unfortunately <b>it's got worse</b> . A spineless <b>3-0 defeat</b> at home to <b>Margate</b> . After the win at Atherstone and creditable draw with Boston, we've slipped back again to our early season form. Come on.</p>
  <p>On a (slightly) brighter note, Catalogue Man <b>Paul Harding</b> has finally signed for <b>Dulwich Hamlet</b> after being on loan there for a while. Good riddance. Also, I believe we've got a match next weekend against <b>Dorchester</b> , rearranaged to take advantage of our free FA Cup weekend.</p>
