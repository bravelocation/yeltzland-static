        <h1>A TEAM FIGHTBACK</h1>
        <h2>Dorchester 2 Yeltz 2</h2>
        <h3>02 October 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>After the last few results and given a <b>half-time</b> score of <b>2-0 down</b> , spirits were about as low as they've ever been. However, something remarkable happened. Second half goals from <b>Darren Wright</b> and on-loan <b>Stuart Payne</b> meant we came away from Dorchester's super-stadium with an encouraging point.</p>
  <p>We're still struggling in the table having played more games than everyone else now, but they way things have been going I'm sure we'd all have settled for a point before the game.</p>
  <p> <b>Bath</b> beat Farnborough in their FA Cup game, so our game on the 16th will be <b>postponed</b> . We're on FA Trophy duty at Bromsgrove next week. Fingers crossed.</p>
