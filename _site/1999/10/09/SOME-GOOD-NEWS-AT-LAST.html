        <p>
  <p>A <b>first Trophy victory for 4 years</b> and a little gloom has been lifted. An emphatic <b>5-2 victory</b> over struggling <b>Bromsgrove</b> and at least we have something positive to look forward to for the rest of the season. Scorers were <b>Crispy</b> , <b>Clinton Thomas (2)</b> , one from <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b> and an <b>own goal</b> .</p>
  <p>We're not playing for a couple of weeks, so maybe it'll give us chance to recharge our batteries, sort out a few injuries and start climbing back up the table.</p>
  <p>LATE NEWS: We've been drawn <b>at home to Sutton Coldfield</b> in the next round of the <b>FA Trophy</b> - the match will take place on November 27. Not a bad draw at all.</p>
