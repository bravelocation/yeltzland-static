        <h2>Merthyr 1 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>13 November 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>After starting to put a decent run together, we've now lost two 1-0 away games on the trot.</p>
  <p>We were on the pools for the first time for ages because most games had been rearranged because of the&#xD;
		Scotland-England game. I'm not sure how many of you decided to loyally make the trip down to Wales, &#xD;
		but I'm sure the rest of us part-timers would appreciate it if you sent in a match report.</p>
  <p>A little bit of good news is that  <b>Stuart Payne</b>  has been signed from Kiddy after a successful loan period,&#xD;
		and we've also signed midfielder  <b>Neil Cartwright</b> , who's previously been at Telford, Kiddy and the Albion.</p>
  <p>Contrary to what I might have said earlier, the  <b>League Cup game against Evesham is away, and this Tuesday (16th)</b> .&#xD;
		Apologies if anyone was misled, but I wouldn't depend on any information you find on this site :-)</p>

<h3>Match Report from Kev Without Trev</h3>

  <p>AS ONE OF THE VERY FEW WHO BOTHERED TO GO, I GUESS IT'S&#xD;
MY DUTY TO WRITE A REPORT. THE LAST TIME OUR SUPPORT &#xD;
WAS OUT-NUMBERED BY THE COMMITTEE WAS A COLD THURSDAY NIGHT IN GRETNA AND LIKEWISE THE TRAVELLERS &#xD;
ON SATURDAY NOW HAVE A CLAIM TO FAME.  WE WERE THERE&#xD;
WHEN OUR SUBS BENCH WAS ANNOUNCED AS WRIGHT, WRIGHT&#xD;
AND CARTWRIGHT. THE REST OF THE TEAM WAS AS FOLLOWS:-</p>
  <p>DANNY,&#xD;
LLOYDY, WOODY, GARDS, JASE,&#xD;
BROWN, BIRCHY, SMITHY, CRISPY,&#xD;
CLINTON, PAYNEY.</p>
  <p>THE GAME STARTED IN CONTRAVERSY BEFORE I HAD EVEN WALKED AROUND THE BACK OF THE STAND.  LLOYDY APPARENTLY HAD TAKEN &#xD;
OUT THEIR RED HOT MARKSMAN MITCHEL AND GOT HIM CARRIED OFF WITHOUT BEING BOOKED, WHICH WAS NICE!  IT SOON BECAME APPARENT &#xD;
THAT THE REF HAD LEFT HIS CARDS AT HOME AS THERE WAS NO END OF TICKING OFFS WITHOUT A CAUTION IN SIGHT.</p>
  <p>MERTHYR HAD THE BEST OF THE FIRST HALF BUT NEVER LOOKED LIKE GETTING PAST DANNY.  WE DID NOT LOOK SHARP AND JUST LIKE &#xD;
TUESDAY WERE FAR TOO CAUTIOUS IN THE EARLY STAGES. OUR ATTACKING PLAY REVOLVED AROUND OVER THE TOP BALLS FOR CLINTON TO &#xD;
CHASE WITH PAYNEY ON HAND TO PICK UP THE SCRAPS.</p>
  <p>JUST ON THE STROKE OF HALF TIME PAYNEY BROKE CLEAR OF THEIR DEFENCE WHO LOOKED A MILE OFFSIDE TO ME, &#xD;
BUT SHOT EMBARASSINGLY WIDE WITH ONLY THE KEEPER TO BEAT. WE LOST CLINTON AT THE START OF THE SECOND HALF WITH A &#xD;
KICK ON HIS ALREADY INJURED KNEE.  EVRAN WAS THE REPLACEMENT AND WE STARTED TO LOOK AT LITTLE MORE DANGEROUS.</p>
  <p>THEY WENT AHEAD HOWEVER ON AROUND 70 MINUTES, SLIGHTLY AGAINST THE RUN OF PLAY, WITH A LUCKY TWICE DEFLECTED SHOT.  &#xD;
THIS FORCED US TO BE MORE ADVENTUROUS. HOWEVER, THEY SOAKED UP THE PRESSURE, EVRAN COMING  CLOSEST WITH A HEADER CLEARED &#xD;
OFF THE LINE IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES.</p>
  <p>GENERALLY, WE ARE LOOKING TO DEFEND RESULTS TOO MUCH AND ARE GIVING THE OPPOSITION MORE RESPECT THAN THEY DESERVE. &#xD;
THE GAME SEEMED TO BE CRYING OUT FOR SOME OF ADA COOPER'S PENETRATING LEFT-HAND RUNS INTO THE BOX BUT, &#xD;
FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, HE WAS DROPPED COMPLETELY BY CHAMBERS.</p>
  <p>AFTER THE WHISTLE, LLOYDY CAME UNDER A TORRENT OF ABUSE FROM THEIR FANS AND NUMEROUS THREATS WERE MADE TO HIM.  &#xD;
UNFORTUNATELY, THE COACH LEFT AT 5.15 PM, SO I WAS UNABLE TO FIND OUT IF ANY OF THE THREATS WERE CARRIED OUT.</p>
