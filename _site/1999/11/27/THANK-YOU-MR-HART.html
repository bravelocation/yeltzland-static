  <p>It's our best FA Trophy for years - getting through 2 rounds!</p>
  <p>It was a strange game. We had loads of chances with young Payne being the most wasteful, and two the goals&#xD;
	we're due to ex-Yeltz star Mark Hart in the Sutton goal but it was reasonably easy in the end. Seeing I was&#xD;
	actually at the game for once you can read my  match report &#xD;
	for full details.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings a long trip down to  <b>Weymouth</b> , then after that there are two cup games: away&#xD;
	to  <b>Burton</b>  in the  <b>League Cup</b> , and then away to  <b>Boldmere</b>  in the  <b>B'ham Senior Cup</b> .</p>
