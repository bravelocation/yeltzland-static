    Sorry for the delays in reporting what happened (nothing unusual there really), as my&#xD;
	usual channels failed me. Anyhow, the bad news is we lost and I'll just refer you to the &#xD;

  <p>The Boldmere game was called off at the last minute, and has been rearranged to next Tuesday (the 21st).</p>

<h3>Match Report from Doc</h3>

  <p>Poll, you bloody part timer</p>
  <p>I managed the jaunt from Barnet to Burton and gosh was it worth it? (No). We lost 3-2.</p>
  <p>We went 1-0 up with a great run and curling shot from Birchy and generally played &#xD;
very well in the first half. Having said that, we were lucky to go in 1 up, &#xD;
as Burton missed a penalty shortly after we'd scored. We were knocking the ball about really well and looked &#xD;
the better team. Woody was all over one of their blokes as he ran into the box and the linesman gave a reasonably valid pen.&#xD;
Matt Siddaway had no probs with the save though, diving to his right to stop a tame effort.</p>
  <p>Er, then they scored 3 times in the first 7 minutes of the second half. Birchy and Crispy went off injured at half time, replaced by &#xD;
Darren Wright and Ashley Brown and we lost all creativity. Their first was a bullet header from a cross and the &#xD;
second two were after mazy runs through our by now non-existent midfield.</p>
  <p>We battled well-ish after this but we never really created anything, oh, &#xD;
apart from when Payney scored with 5 minutes to go. &#xD;
Not even the late arrival of Ross "the new Elmeshinio" Collins could do anything and we lost 3-2.</p>
  <p>Tosh, posh, trussock and fourpence. Bloody stupid competition anyway.</p>
