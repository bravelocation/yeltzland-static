        <h1>YELTZ ATTACK FROZEN OUT</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 0 King's Lynn 0</h2>
        <h3>18 December 1999</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Well there was a lot of effort without any real quality, and on a freezing-cold day, some excellent goalkeeping&#xD;
	on both sides led to a 0-0 draw.</p>
  <p>The front two (Clinton and Payne) toiled hard without getting any decent service from midfield where young Birch&#xD;
	was missing, and their central defenders soaked up just about everything that went their way. Danny made several brilliant&#xD;
	saves to keep us in it, although the best chances of the game fell to new bloke Scott Gennard (poked just wide)&#xD;
	and Payney (he blocked the keeper's clearance but couldn't force it home).</p>
  <p>
    so our next games are now on the  (3pm kickoff) and then &#xD;
	 (also 3pm).

<h3>Match Report from Travis Bickle</h3>

  <p>
    So cold, so very very cold. And with a result as boring as this it really &#xD;
was cold. The first half began well with a Neil Smith(?) header hitting the &#xD;
bar and the ensuing scramble failed to result in a goal. Kings Lynn then &#xD;
dominated the half with Danny keeping us in the game with a couple of good &#xD;
saves. In the last 5 minutes of the half a 35 yard shot from Matty Gardiner &#xD;
was well saved by Martini (shaken not stirred?).
    
      <i>(I thought it was Wayne Lloyd - ed)</i>
    
  </p>
  <p>The second half was possibly the dullest 45 minutes of football I have ever &#xD;
seen with neither side taking any advantage due to a pudding of a pitch and &#xD;
a pudding of a ref. When Clinton's knee got done in again it appeared a &#xD;
nil-nil would be the result. His replacement Scott Gennard (one for the &#xD;
future) went close, but shot wide from 12 yards. We may well have got the &#xD;
winner when a clearance from Martini hit Payne, but he failed to score from &#xD;
such an acute angle. It's games like these which make me wonder why I ever &#xD;
bother to turn up every other week.</p>
