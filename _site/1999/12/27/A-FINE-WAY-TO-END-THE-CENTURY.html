  <p>Hope everyone had a Merry Xmas - I think we all got one of the presents we wanted with a 2-1 victory&#xD;
	over Burton.</p>
  <p>I'm still on me hols so I'm afraid I know nothing but the scoreline at the moment - &#xD;
	normal service should be resumed after the  <b>Gloucester game on the 3rd</b>  (kickoff 3pm).</p>

<h3>Match Report from Mark Wheatley</h3>

  <p>An excellent game for the Xmas season with  a terrific result for Halesowen.</p>
  <p>After Burton had the better of the opening minutes Yeltz took the lead after the ball was driven across the face of goal&#xD;
by Scott Gennard. Scott was involved in the secong goal when he cleverly chipped back across goal for Adrian Cooper&#xD;
to head home. Shortly afterwards Cooper missed a hanging volley which could have settled the game. &#xD;
It was then Burton who went close and forced a great save from Danny low down at the post. &#xD;
Their best chance was a volley which was blazed over.</p>
  <p>The second half was a rear guard action except for a one on one for Cooper but the keeper made a good save.&#xD;
Burton finally got a goal and the final 30 minutes was a seige but good defending and a FANTASTIC save from &#xD;
Danny when one on one ensured that the 3 points remained at The Grove and sent the Albion fans&#xD;
probably feeling that they deserved a share of the spoils. My MOTM Danny - outstanding.</p>
