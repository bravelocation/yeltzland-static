  <p>So close. In a fluctuating battle against Conference side Doncaster, the mighty Yeltz lost by the &#xD;
	odd goal in 5 after coming from behind to take the lead in extra time.</p>
  <p>The game kicked off 45 minutes late, and was goalless until  <b>Donny took the lead</b>  just after half-time. However we soon struck&#xD;
	back from  <b>Evran Wright,</b>  back in his 12th spell at the club after trying to retire. That took us into extra-time,&#xD;
	where we took the lead through  <b>Crispy,</b>  but they drew level before the extra-time break, and then unfortunately scored the winner&#xD;
	with 9 minutes to go.</p>
  <p>I got all of the above from an awful evening watching the Ceefax, so  <b>any match reports are, as usual,&#xD;
	gratefully received.</b> </p>
