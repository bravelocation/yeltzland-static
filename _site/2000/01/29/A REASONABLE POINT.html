        <h1>A REASONABLE POINT</h1>
        <h2>Clevedon 0 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>29 January 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>On an extremely windy day, the Yeltz battled to a much needed point away at Clevedon. &#xD;
	The weather ruined the game, but they've had a pretty good record at home so it's not too bad.</p>
  <p> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=29012000">The table</a>  makes pretty worrying reading. The bottom 3 are really struggling,&#xD;
	but we're only 6 points above Crawley who hold that last relegation spot. The next two games, at HOME to Newport and&#xD;
	Merthyr are looking very important.</p>
  <p>There's been all sorts of rumours flying about saying Birchy is leaving for Â£20,000 to Bishop Auckland,&#xD;
being replaced by Robbie Slater. This seems particularly unlikely to me, but if anything happens as usual this site&#xD;
will bring you the news a couple of days late :-)</p>
  <p>I believe we have signed Steve Taylor, a forward and semi-pro international from Kiddy. With Ian Olney and Evran back in retirement, I reckon&#xD;
that takes our fit strike force back up to 3.</p>
  <p>There's an exciting new addition to the site this week - all the latest details of travel to away games brought&#xD;
	to you by the HTFC Travel Club. This is maintained by Kev who runs the club, so the information should be reliable.&#xD;
	Full details are on the  <a href="/travel/">Travel Club</a>  page.</p>
