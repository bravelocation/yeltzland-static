        <h2>Yeltz 2 Newport 0</h2>
        <h3>05 February 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Back at the ranch, The Yeltz grabbed a much needed 3 points with a 2-0 victory against Newport. A  <b>Crisp penalty</b> &#xD;
	just before half-time and a second from  <b>the gas man</b> just after has left us looking a bit more comfortable&#xD;
	in  12th place. </p>
  <p>We're due to play Solihull in the Worcester Senior on Wednesday. The Yeltzline didn't mention &#xD;
	anything about it, but thanks to everyone who've confirmed that the game is on (played at Redditch)</p>
  <p>Next Saturday is the annual visit of our Welsh friends from Merthyr. The Jolly Boys are playing their supporters&#xD;
	in the morning before the game, and we'll be hoping for our usual victory in both games :-)</p>
