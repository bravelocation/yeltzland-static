        <h2>WSC  Solihull 1 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>09 February 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Well that leads just our fascinating League campaign. The Yeltz crashed out of their only remaining&#xD;
	Cup competition - the prestigious Worcestershire Senior - losing to Solihull 1-0.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings the annual visit of our Welsh friends from Merthyr. The Jolly Boys are playing their supporters&#xD;
	in the morning before the game, and we'll be hoping for our usual victory in both games :-)</p>
  <p>I'm away for a few days over the weekend, so unfortunately the site may not be updated until early next week.</p>
