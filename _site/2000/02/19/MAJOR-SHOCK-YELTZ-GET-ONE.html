        <h1>MAJOR SHOCK - YELTZ GET ONE</h1>
        <h2>Boston 4 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>19 February 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Well it wasn't totally unexpected, but the manner of the defeat at league leaders Boston was very disappointing.</p>
  <p>3-0 down at the break following some pretty poor defending, things didn't get much better when Cartwright was &#xD;
	sent off for elbowing an opponent in the face. After that, we held them pretty well and even got one back with a &#xD;
	long-range effort from Ada Cooper, but they got a fourth near the end.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Ken Fox from the  <a href="http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/primavera/boston/">Boston web site</a> , we've got a couple of&#xD;
	video clips of goals from the game. See my  match report for details</p>
  <p>We're still in 13th place , but we're now only 3 points above rapidly improving Crawley in that last relegation place, and we're not exactly the form team at the moment.</p>
  <p>There's no game for a couple of weeks now until the visit of title-chasing Bath to The Grove. Things are looking good, aren't they :-(</p>
