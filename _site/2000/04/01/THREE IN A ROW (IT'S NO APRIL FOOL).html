  <p>It's taken some time, but the mighty Yeltz have finally hit some form with three excellent wins in the league. &#xD;
	The latest victory was another away victory against a team near the top of the table, a 2-1 win at Tamworth. Goals from&#xD;
	Richard Crisp and returning favourite Ian Reed before the break means we're now 10 points above the drop zone and&#xD;
	in a healthy  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=01042000"&gt;12th place</a>  in the table.</p>
  <p>You may have seen some "interesting" comments from John Chambers about people who visit this site in &#xD;
	the Halesowen News this week (it's at  <a href="http://www.thisistheblackcountry.co.uk/bc/stour/sport/halesfc/"&gt;http://www.thisistheblackcountry.co.uk/bc/stour/sport/halesfc/</a> &#xD;
	if you haven't). All I'd like to add is:</p>
  <p>Anyway it's nice to know Mr Chambers has been to the site. I'd just like to say if he'd like to comment on anything on the site,&#xD;
	or even have a regular page where he could put over his thoughts or point of view that would be brilliant. My email address&#xD;
	is  <a href="mailto:poll@yeltzland.net"&gt;poll@yeltzland.net</a> .</p>
