    Unfortunately I'm in the USA on business this week so the usual slightly out-of-date coverage may be even slower. This also means I'm even more dependent on you lot to send me match reports, details, gossip etc. so just &#xD;
 at the usual address and I'll try and get stuff up ASAP.
    
  </p>
  <p>All I do know is good - a fourth straight win - this time at home to Havant with a goal from young superstar Ian Aldridge, and we're up to a much healthier 11th place. Hurrah!</p>

<h3>Match Report from Mark Holt</h3>

  <p>And so our run stretches to an incredible 4 games won. The goal came in the&#xD;
first 10 minutes when a header from Clinton hit the bar and the ball fell&#xD;
kindly to Ian Aldridge who couldn't miss from a couple of yards out. Then a&#xD;
few minutes later Aldo missed a rebound from a saved Clinton shot. The next&#xD;
30 minutes passed with little action(I think).</p>
  <p>The second half started like&#xD;
the first had ended but it sprung back into action when "Our Ashley" had a&#xD;
dipping shot from a tight angle which hit the bar. Then Clinton missed a&#xD;
shot from 5 yards out after a well worked freekick. However this was nothing&#xD;
compared to the fun which was had by all when Salvatore Bibbo (is his name&#xD;
better than Chuck Martini's?) handled a Ian Aldridge lob which seemed sure&#xD;
to be finished by Aldo. Bibbo was sent off for this offence and for the last&#xD;
10 minutes an outfield player had to take his place (not sure of the blokes&#xD;
name). From the resulting freekick (incidentally the wall was never 10 yards&#xD;
cos the freekick was taken on the very edge of the 18 yard-box with the wall&#xD;
standing a yard behind the penalty spot which means the wall was surely only&#xD;
7 yards). The replacement keeper saved well for a defender from the&#xD;
freekick. Although this result means we are in 11th place we surely deserved&#xD;
to win this one about 3-0.</p>
