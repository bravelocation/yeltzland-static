        <h1>END OF THE RUN</h1>
        <h2>King's Lynn 1 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>15 April 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>After 5 unbeaten games that's taken us to the brink of safety, the rejuvenated Yeltz lost 1-0 away at King's Lynn. Despite having a good majority of the play, without wonderchild Ian Aldridge we struggled to convert our possession into goals and went down to a King's Lynn winner just after half-time.</p>
  <p>In other games, losses for Rothwell and Atherstone (6-0 at Grantham) means those two will now definitely finish in the relegation zone - I hesitate to say are relegated after what's happened over the last few seasons. At the top, Boston still need a couple of points to finally clinch a well deserved title.</p>
  <p>Just four games left now, starting with the visit of in-trouble Gloucester to The Grove on Saturday. A win for us would definitely make us safe and would just about send them down so it should be an "interesting" affair.</p>
