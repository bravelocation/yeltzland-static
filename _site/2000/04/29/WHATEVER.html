        <h1>WHATEVER</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 3 Rothwell 3</h2>
        <h3>29 April 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>It was disappointing not to beat the team bottom of the league, but it was an entertaining affair that didn't matter one little bit.</p>
  <p>They took the lead early on, but we soon equalised with  <b>Neil Cartwright</b> 's first goal for the Yeltz. In the second half we went behind again from what looked a pretty dubious penalty, but then equalised through a 25 yard rocket into the top corner from  <b>Neil Smith</b> , and then straight after took the lead through not-so-young(!)  <b>Ian Aldridge</b> . They then went and spoilt it by scoring a cracking equaliser right at the end.</p>
  <p>The main news of the week is  <b>John Chambers has been offered a two year contract</b> , which he has accepted. After a rocky patch in mid-season, things have definitely taken an upturn in the last few games. Let's now all get right behind the manager and the team, and let's hope we can be back among the title chasers next season.</p>
  <p>Next week is the traditional  <b>last-away-game-fancy-dress-party</b>  at Margate. The Jolly Boys and Girls are going as nuns and monks, but I'm sure the rest of you have got equally daft ideas. I'll also be  <b>presenting the Fantasy Island prize</b>  at some point if I don't manage to lose it somewhere like last year :-(</p>

<h3>Match Report from Adam Clarke</h3>

  <p>We played poorly at the start of the game. We were disappointed when they scored but were pleased when the team started to play better.&#xD;
The second and third goals we scored were brilliant and we deserved the goals and we were unlucky for them to equalize in the last minute.</p>
  <p>Let's hope we get better in the new season and it is good news that the season ticket prices have not gone up for children. Thanks to everyone at Halesowen Town for the free match at the weekend!</p>
