        <h1>IT WAS SUNNY</h1>
        <h2>Margate 3 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>06 May 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>It was a beautiful day by the seaside, we were all dressed up in silly costumes but unfortunately a football match broke out. Luckily nobody seemed too bothered and we went down 3-1 on the slopiest pitch since we flattened The Grove many years ago.</p>
  <p>We were missing quite a few players, went behind but then equalised through Cartwright in about the 10th minute of injury time whilst most people had already gone to the bar. They were a pretty decent team, and whilst we never really looked like adding to our score they always looked threatening and deserved their victory.</p>
  <p>So we ended up smack in the middle of the table in  11th place  with a nicely symmetrical 14 wins, 14 draws and 14 losses. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Obviously the site won't be updated as regularly through the summer, but I'll try and bring you any news that I know whenever I can. Enjoy Euro 2000, and let's hope for a successful season next year.</p>

  <p>Halesowen ended their tenth season of Premier football with a disappointing &#xD;
defeat at the hands of third placed Margate despite their fans partying in &#xD;
traditional end of season fancy dress.</p>
  <p>Halesowen soon came under pressure when stand-in goalkeeper Scott Turbutt &#xD;
failed to hold Eliot Martin's 7th minute corner but his defence scrambled &#xD;
clear Tony Dixon's header. Clinton Thomas then headed against his own &#xD;
crossbar from another left wing corner kick as he attempted to clear. &#xD;
Margate finally made the breakthrough five minutes before the interval when &#xD;
Mark Greatorex pounced on indecision by Wayne Lloyd to slot past Turbutt.</p>
  <p>In a rare break up the slope, Neil Cartwright equalised for Halesowen on &#xD;
the stroke of half time with a low 12 yard drive which eluded Lee Turner in &#xD;
the Gate goal.</p>
  <p>Margate quickly regained the lead in the 48th minute when Turbutt spilt &#xD;
another left wing cross allowing Iain O'Connell to fire home the loose ball &#xD;
from 15 yards. Lee Williams then saw his headed goal disallowed for offside &#xD;
but with Margate well on top the third goal arrived after 65 minutes with &#xD;
Phil Collins heading home a right wing corner from Jay Saunders.</p>
  <p>Manager John Chambers sent on Stuart Payne and Scott Gennard to bolster &#xD;
Halesowen's attack in the 66th minute, but Margate were able to coast to &#xD;
victory against the understrength Yeltz.</p>
