  <p>Not a good start to the summer's transfer dealings.  <b>Danny has signed for Worcester</b>  for a large &#xD;
signing on fee so we'll be playing against him last year. It's disappointing that he's gone there, &#xD;
but what can you do if clubs are going to offer loadsamoney? According to the Halesowen News we've signed Scott Turbutt permanently as a replacement.</p>
  <p>First news of friendlies (thanks Chas!): at home to  <b>Hednesford</b>  on July 29th, and away to  <b>Weston</b> &#xD;
on August 5th. As soon as I hear any more (so if you know anything please  <a href="mailto:poll@yeltzland.net">mail me</a> )&#xD;
I'll post it here.</p>
