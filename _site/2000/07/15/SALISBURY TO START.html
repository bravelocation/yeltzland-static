  <p>The fixtures are out - the full list is on the  usual fixtures page  - thank you Mr. Yates.</p>
  <p>We start  <b>away to Salisbury on August 19th</b> , and that all important  <b>last away game</b>  will involve a lovely trip down to Sarf London for the game against  <b>Fisher Athletic</b> .</p>
  <p>The latest transfer news/rumours are that  <b>Paul Birch</b>  won't be playing next season (coaching at Villa Academy);  <b>Neil Smith</b>  hasn't re-signed as yet (if at all);  <b>Sam Bowen</b> , the Worcester forward, is out of contract and has been talking to Mr. Chambers.</p>
  <p>Just a week and a bit to go now until the first friendly against Hereford on the 25th. Hurrah!</p>
