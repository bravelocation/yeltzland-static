  <p>Just a few days to go to the first friendly against Hereford. It's a bit sad but I'm very excited about it.</p>
  <p>A few more bits and pieces of news you might have missed if you don't subscribe to the&#xD;
	 Yeltz Mailing List . We've signed two more players:&#xD;
	 <b>Neil Manton</b> , a defender from Redditch and  <b>Craig Mansell</b> , a midfielder from 	Weymouth. Also, it appears  <b>Ian Aldridge</b>  has decided to play for Oldbury this season - a surprising one that.</p>
  <p>There's been an early change to the  fixture list  - the  <b>game on Bank Holiday Monday against Newport has been switched to The Grove</b>  (7,45pm kickoff) - they've got some stupid athletics meeting or something.</p>
