        <p>
  <p>After the fine performances in the pre-season games, the mighty Yeltz were brought back to earth with a &#xD;
disappointing  <b>defeat at Salisbury</b> . However it was a promising performance; we played some nice stuff at times &#xD;

A few more details in the  match reports .</p>
  <p>Tuesday brings  <b> <a href="http://www.staffordrangers.co.uk">Stafford Rangers</a> </b>  to The Grove for our first home&#xD;
game of the season. Come on!</p>
