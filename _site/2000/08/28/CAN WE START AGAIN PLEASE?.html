        <h2>Yeltz 1 Newport 3</h2>
        <h3>28 August 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>I know my results in  <a href="/anorak/results.asp">Anorak Corner</a>  only go back 6 years or so, but I really can't remember such a bad start to the season.</p>
  <p>The latest disappointment was a 3-1 loss at The Grove to Newport. They took the lead just before half-time, and then got a second with 20 minutes to go. A goal from Woody promised a tree-men-dous comeback, but a late Newport third clinched all three points for the visitors, and left us in a very worrying  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=28082000">20th place</a> . Not surprisingly, we've got the honour of being the league's lowest goal scorers with a mighty two. :-(</p>
  <p>Saturday brings a long trip down to  <a href="http://www.weymouthfc.com/">Weymouth</a> , who've also had a pretty poor start. It's going to be a thriller.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Dave Johnson</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Wood, Hines, Comyn, Ford, Cartwright, Crisp, Mansell &#xD;
(Collins 65), Griffiths, Payne, Dodd (Piggott 65). Subs: Owen</p>
  <p>Newport County: Mountain; Robison, Benton, Davies, Kemp, Thorne, Rose, &#xD;
Donovan, Hunt, Sheppard, Flynn (Bale 82). Subs: Beckett, James</p>
  <p>Booked: Collins&#xD;
Referee:  M. Forder (Hereford)&#xD;
Attendance: 532</p>
  <p>Halesowen's dismal start to the season continued as they were well beaten &#xD;
by a lively Welsh outfit. Newport were quick off the mark with Garry &#xD;
Sheppard stabbing the ball just wide in the 5th minute before seeing his &#xD;
shot hit the post three minutes later when Andy Quy in the Halesowen goal &#xD;
failed to gather his shot cleanly. Halesowen were lacking penetration up &#xD;
front but Michael Griffiths did turn to fire a 15 yard shot at Pat Mountain &#xD;
in the 11th minute. Newport's pressure finally paid off in the 39th minute &#xD;
when Dave Hunt lashed home a right wing cross from Matt Rose from 12 yards &#xD;
out in front of a vociferous band of travelling fans.</p>
  <p>Quy made two excellent blocking saves from Hunt and Sheppard as Newport &#xD;
continued to dominate the start of the second half and saved Halesowen's &#xD;
blushes again in the 63rd  minute when Sheppard broke free of the home &#xD;
defence with Jason Donovan and Mike Flynn unable to turn the follow up &#xD;
home. Newport went two goals ahead in the 65th minute when Donovan broke &#xD;
through the heart of the Halesowen defence again but this time made no &#xD;
mistake when clear on goal.</p>
  <p>Halesowen eventually pulled a goal back in the 82nd minute when a free kick &#xD;
from Les Hines was met by the head of Phil Wood at the far post. However, &#xD;
Newport made the points safe three minutes from time when Sheppard turned &#xD;
to drill the ball past Quy from 20 yards.</p>
