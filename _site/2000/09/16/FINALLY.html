        <h3>16 September 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>It's been a long time coming but the mighty Yeltz finally registered their first win, stuffing Clevedon 4-1. Two pens from Les Hines, and first goals from Darroch and Mason means we've snuck up to  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=16092000"&gt;20th place</a> .</p>
  <p>
    No news on the manager front as yet, but according to  <a href="http://www.thisistheblackcountry.co.uk/the_black_country/halesowen/sport/halesfc.html"&gt;Halesowen News</a>  interviews will begin this week looking to appoint someone before the FA Cup game in two weeks.
    
  </p>
  <p>Matches this week: on Tuesday we visit  <a href="http://www.staffordrangers.co.uk/"&gt;Stafford Rangers</a> , and then Saturday brings rock-bottom Fisher to The Grove.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Dave Johnson</h3>

  <p>Clevedon Town: Hervin; Rollo, Haines, Peters, Coupe (Skidmore 75), Harvey, &#xD;
R.Ford, Badman, Mehew, Mainwaring, Lester. Subs: Llewellyn, Jeffries</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Hines, Owen, Wood, Lloyd, Comyn, Collins (Cartwright &#xD;
64), J. Ford, Payne (Mason 85), Griffiths (Hodgetts 81), Darroch</p>
  <p>Booked: Owen Referee:  R. Desmond (Swindon) Attendance: 303</p>
  <p>Caretaker manager Alan Moore led Halesowen to their first win of the season &#xD;
at the 8th attempt with the help of two penalties strikes as Halesowen &#xD;
finally put their start of season nightmare behind them.</p>
  <p>However, only 303 were there to witness it - some vague excuses about &#xD;
nuptuals I believe and also the Somerset shortage of fuel at a ground &#xD;
demanding car travel as it's in the middle of nowhere with few houses &#xD;
nearby. However, those that made it will now doubt annoy everyone by saying &#xD;
"where we you when the Yeltz won their first match of the season?". Before &#xD;
I forget, here's a brief stat attack - Scott Darroch's goal was the 700th &#xD;
for the Yeltz in ten and a bit seasons in the Southern Premier.</p>
  <p>The visitors made an ideal start when Iain Harvey tripped Stuart Payne and &#xD;
Les Hines stepped up to score from the resulting penalty in the 9th minute. &#xD;
Jon Ford then drove just wide for the Yeltz in the 17th minute. Clevedon &#xD;
levelled with their first strike on goal in the 23rd minute when Danny &#xD;
Haines cracked home directly from a 25 yard freekick giving Andy Quy no &#xD;
chance. David Mehew struck the side-netting with a glancing header three &#xD;
minutes later from Richard Ford's freekick, but Halesowen regained the lead &#xD;
and control in first half stoppage time when Scott Darroch thundered an 18 &#xD;
yard volley into the angle of the net, taking advantage of Harvey's poor &#xD;
clearance. It was Darroch's first for Halesowen and a memorable strike to &#xD;
register the 700th goal in the Southern Premier for the Yeltz.</p>
  <p>Clevedon were briefly excited in the 50th minute when Richard Ford had a &#xD;
goal disallowed for offside - the flag had been raised several seconds &#xD;
earlier, though the referee hadn't noticed. Jason Owen was then booked for &#xD;
dissent. Quy produced a fine save from Richard Ford in the 56th minute but &#xD;
then in a repeat of the first half, Harvey brought down Payne who had made &#xD;
a great right wing run and Hines again crashed home from the penalty spot &#xD;
to increase Halesowen's lead.</p>
  <p>At 3-1 and the clock ticking horrid visions of Crawley briefly came back as &#xD;
the Yeltz conceeded midfield and gave away the ball cheaply on the edge of &#xD;
their box. However, the brief storm was easily weathered and with the help &#xD;
of substitutions Halesowen went on to record a much deserved win. &#xD;
Ex-Macclesfield man Michael Mason stepped off the substitute's bench to &#xD;
notch Halesowen's fourth in injury time after tricking his way past two &#xD;
defenders and curling the ball beyond Mark Hervin to make Halesowen's &#xD;
victory a comprehensive one.</p>
