<h3>Match Report from Dave Johnson</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Hines, Owen (Payne 45), Wood, Lloyd, Comyn, Collins, &#xD;
Cartwright (Ford 68), Griffiths (Hodgetts 71), Mason, Darroch</p>
  <p>Fisher Athletic: Munden; Powell, O'Neil, Manning, Taylor, Newson, Gamble, &#xD;
Tydeman, Overton, Huggins (Best 68), Barr (Adams 82). Unused Sub: Eagle</p>
  <p>Booked: None Referee:  K. Woolmer (Northampton) Attendance: 413</p>
  <p>Halesowen unveiled Alan Moore as their new manager just before the kick-off &#xD;
but then produced an embarrassingly weak performance to hand no-hopers &#xD;
Fisher their first win of the season.</p>
  <p>The Londoners took the lead on the half-hour when livewire striker Leroy &#xD;
Huggins controlled a long ball from defence before thumping a 15 yard drive &#xD;
past Andy Quy. Quy then punched clear from under his own bar when Hamad &#xD;
Barr delivered a troublesome corner. For Halesowen, Scott Darroch worked &#xD;
hard and sent two efforts wide of goal but it wasn't until the 58th minute &#xD;
that Fisher were troubled when a Ross Collins header was scrambled off the &#xD;
line by goalkeeper Maurice Munden.</p>
  <p>Fisher increased their lead in the 65th minute as Huggins took advantage of &#xD;
another long ball to finish clinically from 10 yards. Substitute Lionel &#xD;
Best then almost made it three with his first touch at the far post. Stuart &#xD;
Payne had a 78th minute header disallowed for offside and substitute Andy &#xD;
Hodgetts missed two late chances but in fairness Halesowen were lightweight &#xD;
in attack and will need to take a long hard look at themselves and how they &#xD;
can move on from here</p>
