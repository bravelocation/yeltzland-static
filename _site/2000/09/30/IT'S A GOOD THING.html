  <p>With our injury list being the length it is, the best thing we could do is try and arrange a week off somehow. So, in the long run, it's a good thing that we lost in the FA Cup to Burton (honest!)</p>

To be honest, it wasn't much of a game - they scored their goals from a couple of defensive lapses (although they also missed a couple of good chances) and we never really created anything going forward. Gary Piggott came on as sub though.</p>
