  <p>With our injury list being the length it is, the best thing we could do is try and arrange a week off somehow. So, in the long run, it's a good thing that we lost in the FA Cup to Burton (honest!)</p>
  <p>We were really struggling to put a team out, especially as we needed to name 5 subs. To be honest, it wasn't much of a game - they scored their goals from a couple of defensive lapses (although they also missed a couple of good chances) and we never really created anything going forward. Gary Piggott came on as sub though.</p>
  <p>There's been an awful lot of moaning on  YeltzTalk  in the last few days, and while I'm not going to censure anyone's views, I'd just like you to bear a few things in mind:</p>
  <p> <b>Can we please all start pulling together, starting with Friday night's game at Ilkeston?</b> </p>
