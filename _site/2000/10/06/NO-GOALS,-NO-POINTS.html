  <p>It's very strange writing this on a Friday night, but unfortunately a change of date didn't result in a change of our fortunes, as we went down to a  <b>1-0 defeat at Ilkeston</b> . According to Dave's  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?06102000#Dave%20Johnson"&gt;match report</a>  it wasn't much of a game (again), but I suppose it wasn't totally unexpected seeing they're riding high in  the league, and we're, well, not. We're still in  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=06102000"&gt;20th place</a>  before the rest of the weekend's results.</p>
  <p> <b>Transfer news</b> :  <b>Griffiths has been released</b>  after a totally ineffective spell, and we've swapped  <b>Scott Gennard with Mr. Sutton from Bromsgrove</b> . Also, it's rumoured that we tried to get Steve Pie-arce back, but Hereford wouldn't play ball.</p>
  <p>I'm sure you've already seen them, but there's some  <b>interesting information on  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/"&gt;YeltzTalk</a>  from various members of the board</b> . There's also a  <b>new vote</b>  afoot in the usual place.</p>
  <p> <b>Next game</b> : we've rearranged the rearranged game at  <b>Newport</b>  to  <b>next Saturday</b>  (the 14th)</p>
