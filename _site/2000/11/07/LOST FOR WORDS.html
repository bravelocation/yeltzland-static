  <p>Another cup, another disappointing defeat.</p>
  <p>I know I'm ridiculously positive at times, but I can't remember things looking so grim. We're not quite out of all the cups (thanks for everyone who reminded me about next week's League Cup game at Bromsgrove), and if Fisher had won tonight - their game was thankfully called off - we would have been bottom of the league. The worst of it is, the way we've played in the last few games shows it isn't really a false position.</p>
  <p>We've got a couple of home games coming up - starting with Tamworth on Saturday - so let's hope we can get something going. So what if we haven't won a game at Fortress Grove since April, this would be a great time to break that streak.</p>
