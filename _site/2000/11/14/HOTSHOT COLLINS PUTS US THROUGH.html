  <p>Oh yes - we've actually won a cup tie!  <b>Two first half goals</b>  from the prolific  <b>Ross Collins</b>  against fallen "giants" Bromsgrove put us through to the next round of the League Cup. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Saturday brings fellow strugglers  <a href="http://www.folkestoneinvicta.co.uk/"> <b>Folkestone</b> </a>  to The Grove in another important league game. However,  <b>next Tuesday's game against Burton MAY (not confirmed yet) be called off</b>  as they have players in the League representative team. More news on this as soon as I hear for certain either way.</p>

  <p>Phil Wood was serving a one-match suspension, so there was just one change &#xD;
to Saturday's line-up and it resulted in another satisfying clean sheet &#xD;
victory for Halesowen on a chilly Bromsgrove evening.</p>
  <p>Bromsgrove were keen to start putting their off-the-pitch troubles behind &#xD;
them but failed to deliver in front of goal. Andy Quy saved well from &#xD;
Richard Burgess in the 34th minute and Mark Benbow headed the following &#xD;
corner over when well placed. Quy then saved well at Craig Pountney's feet &#xD;
before Halesowen tied up the game in a two-minute spell just on half-time. &#xD;
Jason Owen saw a dipping shot turned away for a corner by Nore Gabbidon and &#xD;
although the corner was cleared, Ross Collins drove the ball into the &#xD;
corner of the net. With Collins growing in stature with each game, he made &#xD;
it 2-0 in first half injury time by heading home a Les Hines corner.</p>
  <p>Bromsgrove huffed and puffed in the second half without really creating &#xD;
much danger and it was Halesowen who should have increased their lead as &#xD;
they broke away on several occasions down the slope. Stuart Payne and Peter &#xD;
Sutton both missed opportunities with Hines also going close. Substitutes &#xD;
Ian Aldridge and Mark Williams then combined only to see Gabbidon produce a &#xD;
fine save five minutes from full time.</p>
