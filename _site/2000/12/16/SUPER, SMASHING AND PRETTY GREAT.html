        <h1>SUPER, SMASHING AND PRETTY GREAT</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 1 Merthyr 1</h2>
        <h3>16 December 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>In I guess what should be called an eventful game, the mighty Yeltz ended up with their fourth draw in as many games after a late Merthyr equaliser.</p>
  <p> <b>Sam Bowen looks a feisty sort of a chap</b> , and was at the centre of most of the controversial incidents. He had a running battle with their tiny number 7 which resulted in at least a couple of punches being swapped (although the ref didn't remember this was a sending-off offence); he managed to incite the Merthyr fans by throwing the ball at them (although I'm assuming he was provoked); he also got the faintest of touches on a Les Hines free kick in the second-half for our goal. I like him.</p>
  <p> <b>The referee was abysmal</b> , missing several blatant handballs from both sides. How he decided their number 7 shouldn't be sent off after walking up to Bowen and elbowing him right in front of hime I'll never know.</p>
  <p>Next game: the rearranged League Cup tie against  <b> <a href="http://www.moorgreenfc.co.uk/">Moor Green</a>  at The Grove on Tuesday</b> .</p>

<h3>Match Report from Greg Evans</h3>

  <p>Eventful game. Another draw, another lost lead and another shocking referee.</p>
  <p>Team: Quy, Comyn, Owen, Wood, Lloyd (Crisp), Collins, Smith, Cartwright (Ford), Hines, Bowen (Sutton), Payne</p>
  <p>The 'star' of the show was undoubtedly the referee. He began brightly by disallowing a stunning Merthyr free kick inside 10 minutes. Both sides were baffled by decision after decision, culminating in Stuart Payne being tripped on the edge of the six yard box when about to pull the trigger. Penalty? No chance! Minutes later a punched clearance by a Merthyr defender was also missed.</p>
  <p>Debutante Sam Bowen opened the scoring against his former club, getting the faintest of touches to an inswinging free kick. Merthyr equalised against the run of play five minutes from time. More points thrown away.</p>
  <p>Bowen made an impressive debut, physical and threatening throughout. Merthyr were very physical and often ill disciplined. Bowen twice found himself on the wrong end of Welsh right hooks.</p>
  <p>But one can't help thinking that four drawn home games in which we've lost leads could prove costly come May.</p>
