        <h1>STUFFED</h1>
        <h2>Cambridge 3 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>23 December 2000</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Our long(ish) unbeaten run in the league came to an abrupt end with a  <b>3-0 drubbing at Cambridge</b> . A goal just before half-time, and two just after from the confusingly named Cambridge meant we've now slipped to a depressing  18th place  in the table. Not a very Merry Xmas :-(</p>
  <p> <b>Boxing Day brings local rivals Worcester City</b>  to The Grove (3pm kickoff I believe) and then next Saturday (30th) we finish off a very disappointing year with a game at home to  <b>Ilkeston</b> .</p>
  <p>As I'm on holiday until after the New Year,  <b>the site might not be updated as regularly as usual</b> , but I'll do my best to keep things reasonably recent. Anyhoo, have a jolly Xmas and New Year, and let's hope 2001 brings us better results that 2000 did. :-)</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Cambridge City: Davies; Wooding, Skelly, Randall, Girling, Wenlock (Wilkin 60 (Salmons 75)), Nightingale, Tovey (Browne 77), Bramble, Cambridge, Wilde.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Corns, Ford, Wood, Lloyd, Collins, Crisp, Payne (Sutton 57), Bowen, Smith (Cartwright 55), Hines. Sub: Hackett</p>
  <p>Booked: Corns (41), Bramble (56), Lloyd (58), Wood (67) Referee:  M. Scholes (Buckingham) Attendance: 485</p>
  <p>Halesowen failed to cope with a heavily sanded pitch and were well beaten with Ian Cambridge causing the damage for his namesake team.</p>
  <p>A poor first half came to life on the half-hour when Adam Wilde finished a &#xD;
great run from midfield with a 15 yard shot that was saved by Andy Quy, &#xD;
with Phil Wood clearing for a corner. In a rare moment of danger for the &#xD;
home side Richard Crisp fired into the side netting in the 43rd minute when &#xD;
Stuart Payne's header left goalkeeper Martin Davies stranded out of his &#xD;
goal. However, within a minute Cambridge went ahead when giant striker &#xD;
Tesfaye Bramble turned two Halesowen defenders and crashed the ball into &#xD;
the net off the underside of the crossbar.</p>
  <p>Cambridge controlled the second half and it no was surprise when they &#xD;
increased their lead after 55 minutes. Richard Crisp managed to clear a &#xD;
header from Steve Wenlock off his own goal line, but as his defence &#xD;
hesitated to clear, Ian Cambridge was able to convert from close range.</p>
  <p>Quy made another fine blocking save from substitute Kevin Wilkin who broke &#xD;
clear in the 63rd minute but could only watch as dangerman Ian Cambridge &#xD;
then rattled the crossbar twice in five minutes with two identical 20 yard &#xD;
shots. Striker Cambridge turned home the third goal in the 70th minute from &#xD;
a left wing cross with the visiting defence torn apart.</p>
  <p>In the dying minutes, Neil Cartwight's shot was saved by Davies and a Ross &#xD;
Collins effort was cleared off the line as Halesowen searched for a &#xD;
consolation.</p>
