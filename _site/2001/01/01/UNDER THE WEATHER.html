    The bad weather meant a pretty miserable year was brought to a miserable end with two postponements. A quick nose around  <a href="/anorak/"&gt;Anorak Corner</a>  and I came up with the following stats -  <b>our record in the year 2000 was:</b> To put this into perspective, compare this to  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=01062000"&gt;last year's final table</a>  and I reckon  <b>we'd need a win in the 42nd match not to get relegated</b> . Hmmm.
    
  </p>
  <p>Saturday brings the start of a  <b>long run of away games</b>  (although with our home form the way it is this might be a good thing) with a crucial relegation battle at  <b>Tamworth</b>  - weather permitting of course.</p>
  <p>P.S. Now the holidays are over normal service should be resumed on the site. Apologies for the lack of updates over the last few days, but not a lot happened really.</p>
