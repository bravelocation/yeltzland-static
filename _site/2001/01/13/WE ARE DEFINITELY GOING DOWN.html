        <h2>Yeltz 0 Ilkeston 1</h2>
        <h3>13 January 2001</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>It's getting so desperate that I've having to make predictions of doom like that above - hoping that as my predictive powers are so bad (check out  my score in Fantasy island  if you're not convinced) it'll save us.</p>
  <p>This was another awful loss, going down to a goal just before half-time. That's only 4 points from the last 8 games, we're now in  20th place  and unless things start changing soon we really do have no chance of staying up.</p>
  <p>Next week brings a trip to  <a href="http://www.crawley-town-fc.demon.co.uk/">Crawley</a> , who are currently in 5th place but have only won one in the last seven. Well you never know :-)</p>
