  <p>Another good result - postponed has been about the best we can do recently. It's going to mean a long midweek trip later in the season, but we're bound to be in better form by then :-)</p>
  <p>More squad changes I'm afraid -  <b>Stuart Corns</b>  couldn't get to training because of travel/work stuff and the poor bloke has joined Atherstone. Also,  <b>Craig Mansell</b>  "is still working away from home and cannot train mid-week" which is the official version of why he left that everyone's sticking to.</p>
  <p> <b>The site</b>  - specifically Yeltztalk and Fantasy Island -  <b>has been experiencing a few problems recently</b> , but I think the hosting company have finally sorted things out. I can only apologise for this - if you have any problems can you  <a href="mailto:poll@yeltzland.net">mail me directly</a>  and I'll get on to them again.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday, weather permitting, we're travelling most of the way to France to meet  <a href="http://www.folkestoneinvicta.co.uk"> <b>Folkestone Invicta</b> </a>  in yet another crucial bottom of the table clash. Isn't this fun?</p>
