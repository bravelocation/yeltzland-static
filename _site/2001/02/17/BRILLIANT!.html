  <p>Just like the old days. A dynamic performance from the mighty Yeltz blew Salisbury away to give us some hope (at last) of avoiding the drop.</p>
  <p>We started positively right from the start, with young Skidmore and Smithy particularly excellent in the centre of midfield. We had most of the pressure and  <b>finally took the lead</b>  when  <b>SamBo</b>  headed home from a well-flighted Crispy free-kick.</p>
  <p>Second-half was more of the same. We were passing it about well, although it was from a  <b>fantastic shot from Skidmore</b>  from 30-odd yards that we extended the lead. After a third from a  <b>deflected Bowen shot</b> , we could stop checking our watches quite so often. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Stating the obvious I know, but if we can play like that in the remaining games we can get out of the drop zone. A fantastic performance from everyone today - let's hope that gives us a much needed shot of confidence.</p>
  <p>Two more crucial away games coming up - Tuesday takes us down to  <b>Havant</b>  before another long trip on Saturday to  <b>King's Lynn</b> . Both teams are in the bottom half of  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=17022001">the table</a>  so let's hope for some more points.  <b>BELIEVE! WE CAN STAY UP!</b> </p>
