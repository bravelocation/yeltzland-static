  <p>Well we worked very hard to bore the league leaders into submission and there was only one chance I can remember in the whole game. Unfortunately it fell to them, and our first game under new manager Brendan Phillips was a not too unexpected 1-0 defeat.</p>
  <p>New bloke defender (Richard Walker I presume) looked particularly solid at the back, but I can't even remember our attack having a shot.</p>
  <p>We're now into a run of games that we can and MUST win, starting with King's Lynn at The Grove on Saturday.</p>
