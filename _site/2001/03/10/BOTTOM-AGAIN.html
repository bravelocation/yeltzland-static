        <h1>BOTTOM AGAIN</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 0 King's Lynn 4</h2>
        <h3>10 March 2001</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Plenty of changes both on and off the field, but getting stuffed in a game we really had to win takes us back to the  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=10032001"&gt;bottom</a> , seven points off safety and to be honest looking all but relegated.</p>
  <p>By all accounts we started brightly and should have been ahead before letting in two goals just before half-time. Two more KL goals in the second half led to what must be  <b>our largest defeat at The Grove for years?</b>  - I'll leave that as homework for those of you who want to find that out.</p>
  <p> <b>There have been several signings this week</b>  - DJ has been providing the info (as usual) on the  <a href="/haveyoursay/mailinglist.asp"&gt;Mailing List</a> , but if you're not on that (and why not?) you can see the archives at  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/yeltzland"&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/yeltzland</a>  for all the details.</p>
  <p>There's also been big changes off the pitch - not only a new manager and assistants, but  <b>Ron Moseley has decided to step down as Chairman, to be replaced by Nigel Pitt</b> . It's unfortunate Ron felt it's time to step down, but I'm sure he'll be ably replaced by Nigel. Good Luck!</p>
  <p> <b>Tuesday takes us to Moor Green</b>  in a rearranged league game, and then we've got a free Saturday next week.</p>
