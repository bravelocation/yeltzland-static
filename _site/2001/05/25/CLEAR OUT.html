        <h1>CLEAR OUT</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>25 May 2001</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Some news of who's in and out has been dribbling out, and the list of friendlies is now available.</p>
  <p>First the player news.  <b>Woody and Ralphy Crisp are both out</b> , rejecting 'reduced terms'. They both been tree-mendous players for the club, and will be sorely missed.  <b>Other leavers are James Ince, Jon Ford and I believe Jason Owen</b> .</p>
  <p> <b>Definite (as far as I know) to stay are Dennis Bailey, Les Hines, Jason Burnham, Stuart Skidmore and Ross Collins</b> . Finally,  <b>Andy Quy, Peter Sutton and Clinton Thomas</b>  have been asked to  <b>prove their fitness</b>  at pre-season training.</p>
  <p>As ever, if anyone knows any different either  <a href="mailto:poll@yeltzland.net"&gt;mail me</a>  or post a message on  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/"&gt;YeltzTalk</a> .</p>
  <p>The list of  <b> <a href="/anorak/results.asp?season=2001&amp;team=Halesowen+Town"&gt;pre-season friendlies</a> </b>  has been announced - quite an interesting list including Stourbridge Town, Kiddy, Albion and Blues. First game is on July 14th, so there's a bit to go yet :-(</p>
