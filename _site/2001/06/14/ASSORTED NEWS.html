  <p>We're still in the depths of summer, but there's been a few things happening recently.  <b>If you want more details</b>  during the summer, keep an eye on  <b> <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk"&gt;YeltzTalk</a>  or subscribe to the  <a href="/haveyoursay/mailinglist.asp"&gt;Yeltz Mailing List</a> </b> .</p>
  <p>Firstly, the friendly against Alsager has been replaced by a 'fun' day at The Grove plus a friendly against Causeway. Also, the  <b>League Cup</b>  draw has been made - we're away at  <b>Bilston</b> .</p>
  <p>
    The usual complicated promotions and relegations have now been sorted out, and the final list of Western Division teams has been announced: <b>Atherstone United, Bedworth United, Bilston Town, Bloxwich United, &#xD;
Chippenham Town, Cinderford Town, Cirencester Town, Clevedon Town, Evesham &#xD;
United, Gloucester City, Gresley Rovers, Halesowen Town, Mangotsfield &#xD;
United, Racing Club Warwick, Redditch United, Rocester, Shepshed Dynamo, &#xD;
Solihull Borough, Stourport Swifts, Sutton Coldfield Town, Swindon &#xD;
Supermarine, Weston-super-Mare.</b> 
    
  </p>
  <p>It's believed that the Boxing Day/Easter Monday games will be against the mighty Stourport Swifts. Brings it home how we've fallen, doesn't it?</p>
