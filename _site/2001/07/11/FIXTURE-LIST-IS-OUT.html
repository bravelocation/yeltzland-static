  <p>The  <b>fixture list</b>  for the league has now been published, and thanks to Doc's sterling efffort of sending them to the mailing list I've been able to  <b> add them to the site </b> .</p>
  <p>A few highlights I'll pick out: we start at home to Gresley on August 18; Boxing Day is away to Redditch and the last away game is at Mangotsfield - the rest you can see for yourself on the  full list </p>
  <p> <b>The Causeway game on Saturday is definitely ON</b> . The ground staff as ever have been putting in the work to ensure everything will be ready for Saturday.Very exciting in a sad sort of way :-)</p>
