<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Garvey; Colwell, Gavillet, R. Gallagher, Shaw, Bradley, Asher-Powell, Martin, Thomas, Parnell, Carter Subs: Beckford, Slater, Weston</p>
  <p>Causeway United: Vaughan; N. Skidmore, Jones, Hall, Saunders, R. Shilvock, Baker, Young, Dixon, Richards, Kirkham Subs: Parker, Eveson, Siddaway, M. &#xD;
Gallagher, M. Shilvock, Woods</p>
  <p>Referee: B. Priest (Hayley Green)</p>
  <p>Halesowen manager Brendan Phillips used the first outing of the season to run the rule over a number of on-trial youngsters. And it was ex-Walsall &#xD;
striker Alfie Carter who impressed most, notching two goals in a narrow &#xD;
victory over ground-share outfit Causeway United of the Banks's Premier.</p>
  <p>Carter struck the post from a free-kick in the 13th minute before giving Halesowen an 18th minute lead by calmly slotting home a cross from Ryan &#xD;
Asher-Powell in a move started by Clinton Thomas.</p>
  <p>Causeway produced a sweeping attack on the half-hour when Ian Kirkham broke down the left but Simon Dixon side-footed his cross just wide. Matt &#xD;
Richards then headed Anthony Baker's cross into the arms of Halesowen &#xD;
goalkeeper Mark Garvey's just on half-time.</p>
  <p>Causeway's line-up had a familiar feel from last season, although &#xD;
substitute strike pair Paul Parker and Adan Eveson, both signed from Lye &#xD;
Town, caught the eye in the second period. Eveson equalised in the 67th &#xD;
minute with clever chip over goalkeeper Garvey. But the Yeltz youngsters &#xD;
restored their lead three minutes later when Thomas put Carter clear on &#xD;
goal to finish superbly to cries of "Get Carter!" from the terraces. A late &#xD;
lob from Parker fell just wide and Carter almost completed a hat-trick in &#xD;
the last minute but he hit straight at substitute goalkeeper Siddaway from &#xD;
close range.</p>
