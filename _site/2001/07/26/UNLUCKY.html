        <h1>UNLUCKY</h1>
        <h2>Friendly  Yeltz 0 WBA 1</h2>
        <h3>26 July 2001</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>In a promising performance against a pretty strong Albion side, the mighty Yeltz were a little unlucky to lose 1-0 to the First Division side. Much more detail as usual in  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=26072001#DJ">DJ's match report</a> .</p>
  <p>The friendlies are coming thick and fast now, with a trip to Stratford on Saturday, followed by a shorter one on Tuesday to the Harriers. Just 3 weeks to go now until the real thing.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Piearcy; Skidmore, Burnham, Smith, Barnett, L. Collins, Hall, Spencer, Giddings, Jones, Hines. Subs: Knight, Bailey, Colwell, Shaw, &#xD;
Otto, Crawford, Carter, Donaldson, Garvey.</p>
  <p>West Bromwich Albion: Jensen; Lytlle, Quinn, Jordao, Butler, J. Chambers, A. Chambers, Oliver, Taylor, Dobie, Adams. Subs: Turner, Adamson, M. &#xD;
Collins, Scott, Briggs.</p>
  <p>Referee: R Smith (Hasbury) Attendance: 700 (estimated)</p>
  <p>Halesowen made the early running against a stronger than expected Baggies line-up and Neil Smith headed a Les Hines cross into the arms of Brian &#xD;
Jensen in the 11th minute. Jensen then raced off his line to beat Kerry &#xD;
Giddings to the ball after a clever flick from youngster Andy Spencer.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz missed a glorious chance to take the lead on the hour when skipper Lee Collins touched the ball to Andy Jones but he blasted his &#xD;
chance high from close range.</p>
  <p>Albion were forced to work hard but won the game in the 65th minute as Jordao calmly slotted a left wing pass beyond Jason Piearcy with Halesowen &#xD;
exposed for the first time.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz pushed hard for a late goal and substitute Ricky Otto hit the bar from Andy Spencer's looping cross in the 70th minute. Lee Knight then &#xD;
brought a fingertip save out of substitute goalkeeper Chris Adamson and &#xD;
Adamson was kept busy with two curling efforts on target from Otto and a &#xD;
drive from Alfie Carter.</p>
