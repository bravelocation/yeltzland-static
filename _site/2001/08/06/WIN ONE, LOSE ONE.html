  <p>The friendly season is in full swing now, with just 2 weeks (hurrah!) to the start of the new season. Saturday brought an amazing 5-5 draw at Harrow Borough - full details in the  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=06082001">match reports</a>  section.</p>
  <p>Then on Monday we lost 2-1 to 3rd Division - and doesn't that still sound strange? - Kidderminster. We went one down to an early goal, two down just after the break before getting one back through Dennis Bailey (yes he is back).</p>
  <p>Some disappointing new yesterday:</p>
  <p>Onwards and upwards - two friendlies left now. Blues visit The Grove on Wednesday, and then Boston United are the visitors on Saturday.</p>

Town Football Club to take up a full time appointment as under-19 Academy &#xD;
Coach at Nationwide 1st Division Birmingham City. I would like to wish Dave &#xD;
all the best in his position at the Blues. His work during our time &#xD;
together has been first class and on behalf of everyone at Halesowen Town, &#xD;
I would like to thank him and wish him every success in the future." <b>Brendan Phillips</b>
