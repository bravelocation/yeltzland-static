    One to go. The latest friendly was a reasonable , and there's just the game at home to  on Saturday.
    
  </p>
  <p>As ever, things are looking pretty promising at the moment. Brendan looks like he's built a pretty strong squad capable of challenging for the Western Division title, but hey, I thought we were looking pretty good last year so what do I know??</p>

<h3>Match Report from Greg Evans</h3>

  <p>
    Halesowen :
    
      <pre>Clarke&#xD;
Colwell    Knight       Burnham    Crawford&#xD;
Hall       Skidmore     Carter      Hines&#xD;
           Giddings     Bailey</pre>
    
  </p>
  <p>Subs used: Paul Shaw, Michael Gray, Spencer, Martin</p>
  <p>A creditable draw against a Birmingham side containing Curtis Woodhouse, Kevin Poole and Paul Furlong.</p>
  <p>Bailey and Alfi Carter again stared in a good all round display. Giddings had two good first half chances producing an excellent save from Kevin Poole.&#xD;
Second half Bailey produced an excellent shimmy to round Poole only to see his shot cannon back off the post.&#xD;
The defence, without Lee Collins still looked solid and Tim Clarke was only really troubled on one&#xD;
occasion.</p>
  <p>One time Tamworth midfielder Micheal Gray came on in the second half and ex Kiddy, Walsall and Hereford forward Leroy May was also on the bench but didn't appear. Things are looking good particually if we can hold onto Dennis Bailey and Alfi Carter who would surely have too much quality for the Western Division.</p>
