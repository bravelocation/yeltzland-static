        <h1>NOT QUITE A BOSTIN FINISH</h1>
        <h2>Friendly  Yeltz 2 Boston 4</h2>
        <h3>11 August 2001</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The last friendly, and hopefully not a sign of things to come. We went 3-0 down to Conference side Boston, came back to 2-3 with a screamer from Giddens and a Gray goal, but eventually went down 4-2.</p>
  <p>If you're interested, there's a nice set of  photos of the Blues game  sent in by Peter Blanchflower (thanks!)</p>
  <p>Next week the real season starts with a home game against old time rivals Gresley. We really need to get off to a good start, but I'm very confident (as ever!) that we're going to do really well this season. Come on!</p>

  <p>Halesowen created the first chance when Matty Hall cut through the Boston &#xD;
defence in the 2nd minute and found Alfie Carter who powered a shot at Paul &#xD;
Bastock. However, it was much-fancied Boston who made an impressive opening &#xD;
with Micky Brown striking the post in the 3rd minute before surging ahead &#xD;
with two early goals.</p>
  <p>Mark Angel beat his marker and squeezed the ball past goalkeeper Tim Clarke in the 13th minute and three minutes later the Halesowen defence were &#xD;
caught out again from Angel's right wing corner with Daryl Clare on hand to &#xD;
touch the ball home from close range.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen carved out their own clearcut chances with Hall screwing a sitter wide from ten yards when Leroy May's cross found him unmarked in &#xD;
the 22nd minute. Carter then burst through the heart of Boston's defence in &#xD;
the 34th minute but Paul Bastock saved easily when he tried to place his &#xD;
final shot.</p>
  <p>Five minutes before the break the Pilgrims notched a third goal when Clare crossed from the right for former Telford striker Gez Murphy to head home &#xD;
from close range.</p>
  <p>The Conference side appeared to drop down a gear at the start of the second period allowing Yeltz captain Lee Collins to head a free-kick from Les &#xD;
Hines inches wide in the 51st minute. Carter volleyed wide from Hall's &#xD;
cross on the hour and at the other end Clarke saved well from Clare after &#xD;
Murphy's cross. Boston were then punished in the 69th minute when Kerry &#xD;
Giddings muscled past two defenders before crashing a left foot shot from &#xD;
18 yards into the top corner of the net. Two minutes later Hines set up &#xD;
substitute Michael Gray to plant the ball beyond Bastock as Halesowen came &#xD;
storming back.</p>
  <p>Following a flurry of late substitutions, Clare was brought down in the &#xD;
82nd minute and Boston captain Mike Marsh stepped up to hit the penalty to &#xD;
the right of goalkeeper Tim Clarke to confirm their superiority.</p>
