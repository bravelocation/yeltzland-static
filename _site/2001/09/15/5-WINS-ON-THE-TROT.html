        <h1>5 WINS ON THE TROT</h1>
        <h2>FAC  Yeltz 2 Staveley MW 0</h2>
        <h3>15 September 2001</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>And another. After last year's troubles, it's fantastic to be able to report 5 wins on the trot by the once again mighty Yeltz :-)</p>
  <p>OK, the opposition hasn't been too strong so far but we can only keep winning. Goals from  <b>Leroy May</b>  and  <b>Kerry Giddings</b>  have taken us into the 2nd Qualifying Round, where we'll travel to Moor Green a week on Saturday. That should be an interesting comparison to how much we've improved from last year.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday takes us down to Weston-CanUSeeThe-Mare. They've had a reasonable start to the season, but let's hope we can keep this excellent run going.</p>

  <p>Halesowen avoided slipping up in the potential banana-skin tie against &#xD;
Staveley Miners' Welfare of the Northern Counties East league and made a &#xD;
comfortable passage into the next round against Moor Green. Inevitably it &#xD;
was higher league Halesowen who piled on the pressure, although they could &#xD;
only maintain a slender lead until late on.</p>
  <p>Ross Collins and Mark Taylor sent early attempts wide before Leroy May &#xD;
latched onto a long goal kick from Tim Clarke to lob opposing goalkeeper &#xD;
Andy Hone for a 12th minute lead. However, any hope of a goal avalanche &#xD;
were denied by some determined defending from the visitors.</p>
  <p>Les Hines had a 16th minute shot from 20 yards blocked and five minutes &#xD;
later Andy Jones flicked just wide from Richard Colwell's cross. Staveley &#xD;
won a 26th minute freekick when Ross Collins gave the ball away in &#xD;
midfield, but the defensive wall held firm.</p>
  <p>Andy Jones turned and squirted another shot wide in the 28th minute and &#xD;
Ross Collins had a shot cleared off the line. Paul Sharman then bravely &#xD;
headed away a fierce Taylor shot in a packed Staveley penalty area. &#xD;
Goalkeeper Hone played his part, saving from Andy Jones in the 38th minute &#xD;
and May's overhead kick fell just wide moments before the interval.</p>
  <p>The injured May was replaced by Kerry Giddings at half-time but Halesowen &#xD;
went close again in the 51st minute when Hone saved from Jones after Les &#xD;
Hines took a quick freekick.</p>
  <p>With just one goal in it, Staveley remained in the hunt and had their best spell midway through the second half. In the 57th minute Dave Thomson &#xD;
supplied Dave Chambers with a great opportunity but his shot rolled &#xD;
agonisingly past Clarke's post.</p>
  <p>Halesowen came back strongly towards the end, forcing three successive corners in the 68th minute and causing defender Julian Morris to make two &#xD;
desperate clearances across his own goal before finally wrapping up the &#xD;
tie. Substitute Kerry Giddings, who has developed taste for scoring &#xD;
spectacular goals, bagged another by converting a Les Hines corner with an &#xD;
overhead kick in the 83rd minute. The margin was almost increased in the &#xD;
final minutes, but Welfare's defence did just enough to distract Jones as &#xD;
he raced clear and Hone went on to make another reflex save from a Lee &#xD;
Collins header.</p>
