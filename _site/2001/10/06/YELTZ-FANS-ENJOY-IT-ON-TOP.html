        <p>
  <p>Another brilliant day. Two late goals from  <b>Jones and Giddings</b>  meant we jumped over Clevedon to  <b>lead the  table </b> . Followed by the excitement of the England game, it was quite a day.</p>
  <p>Once again we kept a clean sheet. That's  <b>eight competitive games in a row</b>  now, definitely  <b>a record</b>  according to Chas who knows these sorts of things. There's a long way to go, but I don't think we could have hoped for a better start to the season.</p>
  <p> <b>Tuesday brings Sutton Coldfield</b>  - the only team to beat us this season so far -  <b>down to The Grove</b> . Let's hope for another three points before the welcome distraction of Saturday's FA Cup tie against Canvey Island.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, R. Collins, Hall, Jones, Giddings, Taylor, Hines. Subs: Spencer, Skidmore, L. Knight</p>
  <p>Clevedon Town: Matthews; Lester, Thorne, Peters, Jeffries, Price, K. Knight, Callinan (Clode 59), Bayliss, Cook (Smart 79), Badman. Sub: King</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Marriner (Birmingham) Attendance: 453</p>
  <p>Halesowen marched to the top of the table in their seventh straight win at the Grove and set a club record of 750 minutes of football without &#xD;
conceding a goal.</p>
  <p>The early 12.30 start produced a low-key start and both teams seemed to &#xD;
cancel each other out in the first half. Clevedon's Karl Bayliss drove wide &#xD;
in the first minute with the previous league leaders keen to shrug off the &#xD;
five goal mauling by Shepshed the week before. Andy Jones won a free kick &#xD;
on the edge of the area in the 4th minute but Les Hines hit the kick &#xD;
against the defensive wall. In the 18th minute the visitors dealt with a &#xD;
spell of home pressure with deep crosses from Richard Colwell and Hines. &#xD;
Tim Clarke saw Keith Knight's 20th minute free-kick late but made a good &#xD;
save from Tommy Callinan's low header. His opposite number Matthews &#xD;
collected Burnham's 25th minute cross at the second attempt.</p>
  <p>Halesowen livened up after the break and Matty Hall's cross to Kerry &#xD;
Giddings almost caught out the Clevedon defence in the 46th minute. The &#xD;
turning point came in the 49th minute when Clarke dived full length to &#xD;
produce a superb fingertip save from Steve Lester's 20-yard drive. For &#xD;
Halesowen, Andy Jones turned and hit wide after 50 minutes and Giddings &#xD;
almost latched onto a weak back header from central defender Lee Jeffries, &#xD;
but Matthews raced off his line to clear. Giddings then battled through &#xD;
midfield allowing the influential Mark Taylor to set up Hines to shoot just &#xD;
over in the 65th minute.</p>
  <p>Previous league leaders Clevedon missed a golden chance in the 75th minute &#xD;
when confusion between Clarke and Neil Smith allowed the ball to break to &#xD;
Karl Bayliss but he shot high with the goal at his mercy.</p>
  <p>Just when Clevedon looked on course for a point, Halesowen crafted two late &#xD;
goals through the strike pair of Jones and Giddings. Ross Collins laid the &#xD;
ball off for Jason Burnham to cross in the 82nd minute and Jones poked the &#xD;
ball home from close range with Lee Collins also set to pounce. Two minutes &#xD;
later Jones broke free and set up fellow striker Giddings to sidestep his &#xD;
marker and crack home his seventh goal of the season from 20 yards into the &#xD;
bottom corner.</p>
