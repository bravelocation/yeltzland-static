  <p>A very disappointing result, but at least it removes a distraction from the much more important promotion push. (OK I am clutching at straws)</p>
  <p>We had high hopes before the game, and had maybe the better of the first half without ever threatening, but we're disappointed to go one down just before the break. I hoped we go hell-for-leather in the second half in a good old fashioned Shed End comeback, but despite some rousing support we never really got anywhere and after going two down it was all over. Canvey weren't as impressive as I thought they might be, but are obviously used to winning and did just enough to get through. Good luck to them in the rest of the competition.</p>
  <p>In the league, Solihull beat Clevedon so we're still  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=13102001">top of the table</a> . Saturday brings Cinderford to Town to The Grove in a game that will hopefully bring us back to winning ways.</p>
