        <h2>Rocester 1 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>23 October 2001</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>After a couple of losses it's nice to get something, but before the game we'd have hoped for more.</p>
  <p>I haven't got many detailsso far, but in difficult conditions Rocester took the lead from a speculative shot that deceived Tim Clarke. We equalised in the second half after a golamouth scramble, the goal was maybe given to Leroy May (although my contacts aren't sure about this).</p>
  <p>We've now slipped to  5th place , with Solihull losing but Clevedon, Evesham and Stourport all winning. Saturday brings old rivals Atherstone to The Grove in a game where I'm sure we're going to get back to winning ways.</p>
  <p>P.S. There were odd problems on the site on Tuesday. Apologies for that - it was all my service provider's fault :-(</p>
