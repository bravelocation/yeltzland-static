  <p>A battling performance with 10 men for most of the game, the mighty  <b>Yeltz we're denied a well deserved draw</b>  by a bizarre last minute goal from Barrow.</p>
  <p>Barrow took the lead in the 7th minute from a header, but we soon equalised with a  <b>Giddings</b>  goal - 8 goals and counting now - from a Hines cross. However, things turned for the worse soon after when young  <b>Spencer got sent off</b>  for a reckless challenge.</p>
  <p>The ten men held their own for the rest of the game, and had a few chances to snatch an unlikely victory until  <b>their sickening winner</b>  when Clarke slipped and allowed the ball over him. An awful way to go out, but as ever, let's now just concentrate on getting promotion ;-)</p>
  <p>Next Saturday takes us to lowly  <b>Cirencester</b> , where we need to take 3 points to stay up with the other promotion candidates.  <b>It's a 1pm kickoff</b>  again because of the England game. Rumours of a new striker abound - news here as soon anything's confirmed.</p>
