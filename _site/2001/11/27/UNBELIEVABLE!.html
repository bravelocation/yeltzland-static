        <h1>UNBELIEVABLE!</h1>
        <h2>Stourport 2 Yeltz 3</h2>
        <h3>27 November 2001</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>In a fantastic comeback, the mighty Yeltz gained 3 important points when they came back from 2-0 down to beat local rivals Stourport Swifts 3-2.  <b>Two second half penalties by Jason Burnham</b>  and a late winner following a goal mouth scramble - Chas reckons  <b>Gary Smith</b>  got it - has kept us right in the promotion race.</p>
  <p>It's difficult to say exactly where we are in the  table  as there are strong rumours suggesting  <b>Bloxwich United have resigned from the league</b>  immediately.  <b>If that's confirmed</b>  then it will help us as Chippenham, Clevedon and Solihull have all beaten Bloxwich, whereas we haven't yet played them, and I reckon  <b>we'd go top of the league!</b> </p>
  <p>There are still persistent rumours of new signings, but nothing confirmed as yet. More news as soon as I hear, but it'll appear on  first .</p>
  <p>Saturday brings another away trip, this time a particularly glamorous tie against  <b>Shepshed Dynamo</b> .</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Stourport Swifts: Hipkins; Ulfig, Laker, Townsend, Mullders, Shaw, Southwick, Langford, Marsh, Booth, Nicholls. Subs: Hart, Cooper, Davies</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, R. Collins, Hall (Spencer 66), Jones (G. Smith 45), Giddings, Taylor, Carter (Crawford &#xD;
66)</p>
  <p>Referee: K. Hawkes (Quedgeley, Glos.) Booked: R. Collins (29)</p>
  <p>A game that was steadily heading for a dismal defeat against a scratch &#xD;
Stourport side suddenly turned into an evening that will become Yeltz &#xD;
folklore in the years to come. Halesowen started the day in 5th place in &#xD;
the table, 5 points behind Chippenham at the top and 4 points behind both &#xD;
Solihull and Clevedon. After 70 minutes Halesowen were trailing 2-0 to &#xD;
Stourport. What happened next? Well, suffice to say Halesowen ended the &#xD;
evening at the top of the table. How did it happen?</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued where they left off on Saturday. Plenty of possession, &#xD;
but with their attacks breaking down in the final third. However, this time &#xD;
the defence could not keep up their remarkable record and Stourport took &#xD;
the lead in their first attack after 27 minutes when Lea Shaw diverted home &#xD;
a cross from Matt Southwick with Richard Colwell unable to clear. Tim &#xD;
Clarke then made a tremendous blocking save from Lee Booth who was clear on &#xD;
goal in the 44th minute. However, on the stroke of half-time a free-kick &#xD;
from Southwick was headed on by Steve Ulfig and the ball squirmed past &#xD;
Clarke into the bottom corner to end a disastrous half for Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Gary Smith replaced Andy Jones and worked hard using his experience but the &#xD;
real turning point came with the introduction of the adventurous Andy &#xD;
Spencer in the 66th minute. With Ross Collins suddenly fired up, the Yeltz &#xD;
looked more menacing. Ross Collins was bundled over on a run in the 68th &#xD;
minute and Jason Burnham smashed the resulting penalty down the centre of &#xD;
the goal. Hope renewed. In the 75th minute Mark Taylor worked into the box &#xD;
and was tripped by Southwick for a second penalty. Burnham calmly repeated &#xD;
his previous effort by crashing a piledriver into the top of the net for an &#xD;
equaliser. The winner came against a bemused Stourport in the 90th minute &#xD;
when a corner from Taylor was pushed forward towards the goal-line by Neil &#xD;
Smith and in a forest of legs, Gary Smith poked into the goal from about a &#xD;
foot out. Players, officials and supporters all went into ecstasy.</p>
  <p>Let me complete the puzzle. Earlier in the day, news filtered through that Bloxwich had failed to fulfil their evening fixture against Bilston and as &#xD;
a result of a meeting the previous evening had in fact resigned from the &#xD;
league. A quick look at the results grid showed that Halesowen had yet to &#xD;
play them, whereas the top three had already beaten them. Using a word that &#xD;
only seems to get used when a team goes bust, the record of Bloxwich was &#xD;
"expunged" , leaving Halesowen at the top. An unlikely outcome from only 20 &#xD;
minutes earlier!!</p>
