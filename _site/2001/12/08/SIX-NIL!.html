  <p>Yeltz go goal crazy! With all the  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/"&gt;talk</a>  about our lack of goal power and needing new strikers, maybe things aren't so bad after all. Points clear at the  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=08122001"&gt;top of the table</a> , a second half goal-fest sent the Yeltz fans home very happy indeed.</p>
  <p>We led 1-0 at half-time through yet another  <b>Jason Burnham penalty</b> . We went further ahead through goals from  <b>Leroy</b>  and new bloke  <b>Lee Ross</b> , and then three late goals from  <b>Matty Hall (2) and Gary Smith</b>  led to our biggest win for ages (answers to  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/"&gt;YeltzTalk</a>  please).</p>
  <p>Bizarrely enough, according to Ceefax  <b>both Clevedon and Chippenham also won 6-0</b> , but we've obviously maintained our 4 point lead at the top. The game in two weeks time against Chippenham is going to be a stormer. However, before that next Saturday takes us back to old rivals  <b>Gresley</b> , who we beat 3-0 at The Grove in the first game of the season.</p>
