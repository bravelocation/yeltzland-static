        <h1>IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER</h1>
        <h2>Gresley 0 Yeltz 3</h2>
        <h3>15 December 2001</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Another clean sheet added to another few goals, and the mighty Yeltz march onwards towards next week's important clash against Chippenham in extremely good spirits.</p>
  <p>Goals from  <b>Spencer</b> ,  <b>Matty Hall</b>  and  <b>Les</b>  led to our first win at Gresley for 17 years (the word according to Chas), who had been on a good run themselves. The only piece of bad news was new bloke Lee Ross limping off with a hamstring injury.</p>
  <p>With Clevedon losing we're now  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=15122001">7 points clear</a>  in the promotion standings, and still four points clear of Chippenham although they have a game in hand.</p>
  <p>Tuesday takes us to  <b>Evesham</b>  in the always exciting Worcester Senior Cup, before next Saturday  <b>Chippenham come to The Grove</b>  in a game that it looks like will have a huge impact on the title race. Come on!</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Skidmore, Spencer, Ross (Hall 23), May, Taylor, Hines. Subs: Crawford, G. Smith</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Dawes (Willenhall) Attendance: 496 Booked: Hall (46), Gray (48), Allcock (89)</p>
  <p>Halesowen underlined their promotion credentials with an emphatic victory in a potentially tricky meeting at in-form Gresley.</p>
  <p>The home side started brightly playing up the slope and Tim Clarke did well to hold onto a fierce freekick from Ryan Ford in the 6th minute. Neil Smith &#xD;
made a timely tackle to deny Ford in the area after 22 minutes before &#xD;
Halesowen took control. Despite losing Lee Ross with a hamstring injury, &#xD;
the visitors went on the attack with Andy Spencer playing a key role in &#xD;
supporting the front-line from midfield. The Yeltz went ahead when the &#xD;
lively Leroy May worked down the left allowing Jason Burnham to deliver a &#xD;
fine 34th minute cross and Spencer stole in at the far post to side-foot &#xD;
home from close range.</p>
  <p>Gresley were overwhelmed by Halesowen's neat passing game in the second half and it was no surprise when the league leaders scored a second in the &#xD;
59th minute. Richard Colwell split the Gresley defence, setting Matty Hall &#xD;
free to cross to Les Hines and although his shot was parried away by &#xD;
goalkeeper James Lindley, Hall was lurking to tap home the rebound.</p>
  <p>Well beaten Gresley gifted Halesowen a third goal in the 76th minute when &#xD;
Hall robbed Mark Peters and rolled the ball into the path of Les Hines and &#xD;
he made no mistake with a pinpoint 15 yard shot. The tenacious Stuart &#xD;
Skidmore rushed in to blast a Hall cross just over in the 82nd minute and &#xD;
May hit wide two minutes from time as Halesowen sought more goals in their &#xD;
first victory at the home of their long-term rivals since 1984.</p>
