  <p>Hasn't been much of a year so far has it? What will hopefully be a very sucessful 2002 has got off to a very slow start with the New Year's Day game against Evesham called off because of the bad weather, and us not now playing until the 12th. Oh well, perhaps it will give our promotion rivals a chance to blow some of their games in hand.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately my holiday's are over now, so the site should now be updated a bit more regularly - I hope things we're too bad over the break.</p>
