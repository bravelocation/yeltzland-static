    That's eight wins out of nine now in the league. It's making  a bit easy, but I'm sure (I think) they'll be no complaints from anyone as the mighty Yeltz continue our push for promotion.

  <p>Next Saturday brings Cirencester to The Grove in what I reckon is their first visit - although as you've probably gathered I'm no expert on this sort of thing.</p>

  <p>A solid Halesowen performance ended Gloucester's eight-game unbeaten run &#xD;
and they were set on their way by a superb Stuart Skidmore strike to notch &#xD;
Halesowen's 500th away goal in their Southern League history.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started strongly with Les Hines stabbing wide in the 5th minute &#xD;
and Gloucester goalkeeper collecting a deflected shot from Stuart Skidmore &#xD;
five minutes later. But Will Steadman headed wide with the goal at his &#xD;
mercy for Gloucester from a Lee Smith cross in the 11th minute and a poor &#xD;
throw-out by Halesowen goalkeeper Tim Clarke saw Steadman drive a shot just &#xD;
inches high from 20 yards out.</p>
  <p>The league leaders took a 20th minute lead when Lee Ross headed on for Andy &#xD;
Spencer to lay the ball off for SKIDMORE to hit a screaming volley into the &#xD;
roof of the net from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>Gloucester then enjoyed a good spell of pressure before but Lee Smith saw &#xD;
his 30th minute shot blocked by the Halesowen defence from Darren &#xD;
McCluskey's free-kick. The Tigers came within an ace of equalising through &#xD;
Gary Marshall in the 33rd minute, but Clarke did well to smother his shot &#xD;
on the goal-line. Just before half-time a fierce cross from Hines was met &#xD;
by Spencer but he blazed over from three yards out and Gloucester &#xD;
goalkeeper Matt Bath produced a fine double save to deny Jason Burnham's &#xD;
15-yard shot before turning Spencer's follow-up for a corner.</p>
  <p>The Tigers worked hard for an equaliser in a tough second half but &#xD;
Halesowen were equal to the battle and were superior in their neat approach &#xD;
play. Leroy May set up Lee Ross to blast wide in the 46th minute and a &#xD;
minute later a cross from Steadman went straight across the face of &#xD;
Clarke's goal at the other end. The in-form May then hit just wide after 58 &#xD;
minutes.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz went two goals up when Hines curled in a 74th minute free-kick &#xD;
which was headed behind and from the resulting corner Hines hit a cross to &#xD;
find playmaker Mark Taylor and he rolled the ball across goal for ROSS to &#xD;
poke home.</p>
  <p>Gloucester should have scored a consolation goal when Luke Prince crossed &#xD;
from the left in the 84th minute but Marshall hit over the bar when well &#xD;
placed. Halesowen substitute Gary Smith saw his close-range 89th minute &#xD;
strike from May's cross disallowed for offside.</p>
