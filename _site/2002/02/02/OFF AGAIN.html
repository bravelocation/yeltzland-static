  <p>Bad weather again, and our game was called off because of a waterlogged pitch. With Brendan away perhaps it's not too bad these games being cancelled, and he's back next Saturday but too late to get to Clevedon according to the Halesowen News (!). Seeing as we've played more than most, I don't think any potential backlog is going to hurt us.</p>
  <p>Once again Chippenham could only draw 1-1 at home in their rearranged game at home to Sutton Coldfield, so they're still a point behind having played a game more. It's completely in our hands now.</p>
  <p>Next week is an important game down at Clevedon. They've only got an outside chance of catching us, but a win for us would completely put them out of it. Come on!</p>
