        <h2>WSC  Moor Green 3 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>12 March 2002</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>It's a shame to go out of any cup, but we've got much more important things to concetrate on this year. A bit of a stuffing really by Moor Green which I suppose gives them a little revenge for our FA Cup victory earlier in the season.</p>
  <p>We've now got 10 league games left and 7 of those are at The Grove, so let's hope we can storm to the title with a string of victories. First up are bottom placed Swindon Supermarine on Saturday who have been slightly improved of late, but let's hope for another 3 points.</p>
  <p>Weston drew 2-2 last night against Evesham, which was nice. It's Chippenham v Weston on Saturday, so obviously at least one of them must drop some points too.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Moor Green: Rachel; Robinson, Brighton, Gillard, Softley, Stanley, Myers (Scheppel), Lamey (Petty), Crisp (Gayle), Martin, Peer. Subs: Carter,&#xD;
Antiss</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Newell, Spencer, G. Smith, Jones, R. Collins, Hines. Sub: Skidmore, Taylor,&#xD;
Phillips, Bailey, Garvey</p>
  <p>Referee: A. McIlravey (Redditch) Attendance: 307</p>
  <p>A Les Hines freekick dropped awkwardly into the Moor Green area after 8&#xD;
minutes and just escaped the head of Neil Smith before bouncing out into&#xD;
safety for a goalkick. The Moors took a 10th minute lead after an&#xD;
uncharacteristic mistake by Lee Collins on the right let in Mark Crisp to&#xD;
cross for leading goalscorer Nathan Lamey to prod in his 27th goal of the&#xD;
season. Gary Smith almost equalised in the 13th minute on the break but&#xD;
after cleverly turning the last defender shot straight at the legs of&#xD;
goalkeeper Adam Rachel. Halesowen eventually tidied up some defensive&#xD;
confusion in the 35th minute after a slip by Lee Collins and a bad clearance&#xD;
kick from Tim Clarke.</p>
  <p>Seven minutes into the second half Andy Spencer headed a Hines cross just&#xD;
wide but Halesowen went 2-0 down in the 74th minute when a deep cross from&#xD;
Jae Martin was chested down and despatched from 12 yards past Clarke by the&#xD;
dangerous Lamey. Jason Burnham's 25 yard effort from a freekick was held by&#xD;
Rachel after 80 minutes and Clarke did well to pluck out a Martin shot two&#xD;
minutes later. Four minutes from time a left wing cross from Martin was&#xD;
volleyed home by substitute Danny Scheppel for Moor Green's third goal.</p>
  <p>News of a 2-2 home draw for Weston-SM brought some relief to the end of the&#xD;
evening - despite the earlier report from the Yeltz statistician who watched&#xD;
the game believing Weston had won 2-1! With Halesowen bowing out of their&#xD;
involvement in Cup football for the 2001-02 season, it's now time to&#xD;
concentrate fully on the final ten league games.</p>
