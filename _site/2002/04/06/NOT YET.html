        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz will have to wait a little longer to clinch the league title after only managing a 0-0 draw at Cinderford. It's a little disappointing but we still only need a couple of points to be mathematically sure, and it would be nice to get those at The Grove - hopefully against Gloucester next Saturday.</p>
  <p>I really hope next Saturday will be a happy occasion, and let's extend a warm welcome to all the visiting Gloucester fans. If anyone's thinking of coming just to start trouble, please don't bother - we really don't want anything like that happening at all.</p>
  <p>Chippenham have achieved a sufficient ground grading for the Premier Division, and look almost certain to finish second after winning 4-0 while both Solihull and Weston could both only draw.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Cinderford Town: Fisher; Bale, Hopkins, Tomkins, Hall, Callinan, Truman, Ince, Hook, Addis, Harris. Subs: Weyman, Donovan, Pitcairn</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Davies; Colwell, Burnham, R. Collins, L. Collins, Cowley, Bailey (G. Smith 66), Jones, May, Taylor (Brennan 83), Hines. Sub: Phillips</p>
  <p>Referee:  S. Humphrey (Swindon) Attendance: 363 Booked: Hall (81)</p>
  <p>The Championship champagne remained on ice as Halesowen did everything but score and had to settle for a goal-less draw against a defiant Cinderford. Already promoted Halesowen were prevented from notching an elusive goal to tie up the title and now hope to confirm their Championship at home to Gloucester City next Saturday 13th April, (kick off 3pm).</p>
  <p>The Yeltz were forced to make several changes with five first team players unavailable, but still completely dominated the game with Brendan Phillips electing to play an adventurous 4-3-3 formation and included son Kelvin on the substitute's bench. Young 19-year old Australian goalkeeper Clint Davies made his debut and enjoyed an easy afternoon as Cinderford hardly mustered a shot on target all afternoon.</p>
  <p>Simon Truman saw a 4th minute free-kick drift across goal for Cinderford but as Halesowen went on the offensive Dennis Bailey nodded a Leroy May cross just wide after 6 minutes. Halesowen then forced three successive corners from Les Hines in the 13th minute in which May had a shot blocked off the line. May and Andy Jones bore down on goal from a sweet Mark Taylor pass in the 17th minute, but Jones shot weakly at goalkeeper Andy Fisher. Hines then hit just wide when May laid off a cross from Richard Colwell in the 23rd minute. In continued Halesowen pressure, Alex Cowley did well on the right but Jones lofted the ball high over the bar in the 28th minute. Just before half-time, Bailey headed a 44th minute Jason Burnham cross just over and then screwed a shot wide when put through by Hines.</p>
  <p>Cindeford had beaten the Yeltz at the Grove earlier in the season but never looked able to complete an unlikely double, but they now join Chippenham as the only teams to take four points from the Yeltz over two games.</p>
  <p>Halesowen took up residence in the Cinderford half after the break but still couldn't break the deadlock. Richard Colwell, searching for his first goal of the season, hit a 20-yard shot at Fisher after 47minutes and Ross Collins sliced a good chance well wide on 65 minutes after being set-up by Mark Taylor. Alex Cowley went on a surging 68th minute run but was finally crowded out near goal by the home defence. A dangerous 87th minute Hines free-kick rebounded to Gary Smith who screwed wide and, although May managed to reach the shot with his head, the chance fell just wide. In the final minute Andy Jones met a left wing cross from Hines and turned but saw his shot blocked into the side-netting. Jones then glanced a header inches wide from Colwell's cross in the final chance of the sunny but bracing Gloucestershire afternoon.</p>
