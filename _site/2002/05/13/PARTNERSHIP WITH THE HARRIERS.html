    After all the speculation, the details of our partnership with Halesowen Harriers has been announced. According to the  <a href="/news/pressrelease20020513.asp">press release</a> :&#xD;
&#xD;
Not much of excitement really, other than we're going to have a back and white away kit next year. I recommend you  <a href="/news/pressrelease20020513.asp">read the full release</a>  for yourselves.
    
  </p>
  <p>No news of any transfers as yet, but there's much discussion around Snapper, Rob Elmes and Steve Pie-arce all been released by Hereford. News as soon as I hear anything. There's has been drips and drabs of news of friendlies and I'll add them to the site as soon as someone can confirm the details for me.</p>
