    On the transfer front, we've signed old favourite , and also his ex-Hereford teammate  and attacking midfielder. A couple of good additions to the squad I would say. We won't be getting back ther other old boys Snapper and Piearce as they've signed for Worcester and Hednesford respectively. We're also looking to sign former Wolves reserve striker  if he can prove his fitness.
