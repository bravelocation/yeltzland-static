    Leamington decided to celebrate their new floodlights in style with some half-time fireworks, as Halesowen's team of mostly triallists and newcomers won 3-1 with first-half goals from ,  and .

  <p>Interestingly enough (to me anyway) was the fact that as well as Brendan's son Kelvin, James Coldicott, son of ex-Yeltz superstar Phil also made a second half appearance.</p>
  <p>There's a new vote out if you're interested about how you think we'll get on this season.</p>
  <p>The warm up games continue back at The Grove on Saturday with the visit of First Division Walsall on Saturday. It's getting closer!</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Leamington FC: Sidhu; Burgess, Gregory (Dix 85), Rowland, Crabtree, Timms, Mort (Curphey 74), Webb, Nicholls, Agar (Sahal 45), Thompson.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Garvey (Coldicott 45); Adams, Reece, Newall, R. Collins (Smith 45), Holmes (Elmes 88), Spencer (Henry 45), Goodwin, Quiggin (Spencer 72), Phillips (Webb 45), Tallants.</p>
  <p>Referee: D. Macauley Attendance: 403</p>
  <p>Leamington celebrated the opening of their refurbished floodlights from the Grove with a half-time firework display. Much work has clearly been done at the rural setting of the New Windmill although the recently installed drainage channels created an uneven playing surface.</p>
  <p>Manager's son Kelvin Phillips gave Halesowen a 7th minute lead when he picked up a ball from John Newall and calmly turned the defence before curling the ball into the net. Five minutes later Gareth Holmes, formerly of Derby County, steered the ball home to increase the lead.</p>
  <p>Leamington pulled back a 16th minute goal when visiting defender Richard Adams attempted to clear but only succeeded in turning the ball past his own goalkeeper Mark Garvey. Two minutes before the break Jimmy Quiggin raced in to head home Halesowen's third from a Dominic Reece cross.</p>
  <p>Carl Tallants set up the busy Holmes in the 55th minute but he blasted wide from 10 yards out. Four minutes later Tallants made a fine left wing run but Quiggin volleyed the resulting cross inches high.</p>
  <p>At the other end a 20-yard drive from Steve Thompson was collected low-down by Halesowen goalkeeper James Coldicott, son of former favourite, Phil. Glen Webb was then unlucky in the 69th minute when he headed against the bar and he headed just over again one minute later. For Halesowen, the impressive Holmes set Paul Henry free in the 75th minute but he hit his effort high.</p>
