  <p>Halesowen kept up their 100% pre-season record with a comfortable win over a youthful Walsall line-up who failed to create any clearcut chances in front of goal all afternoon.</p>
  <p>In the first few minutes Andy Jones found plenty of time and space in the Walsall penalty area but he failed to beat goalkeeper Matty Harris after two minutes before striding through the Walsall rearguard from midfield again to fire straight at Harris in the 4th minute. The Yeltz took a deserved 15th minute lead when Andy Spencer lobbed Harris from the edge of the penalty area. Tim Clarke spilled an 18th minute cross from Anthony Maguire but the defence recovered to clear.</p>
  <p>In the second half a surging run from home substitute Jason Ashby let in Richard Leadbeater after 48 minutes but he scooped the ball wide from a good position. Tim Clarke collected a 25-yard free-kick from Alec Cunliffe in the 53rd minute before Halesowen hit a second goal when Leadbeater lashed home a 55th minute right wing cross from Andy Spencer. Ashby then headed just over from a Richard Colwell cross in the 63rd minute and three minutes later the lively Ashby turned the Walsall defence to set up Spencer but Harris tipped his 10-yard shot over the bar for a corner.</p>
  <p>Les Hines hit home from the penalty spot after 69 minutes when Asby was up-ended in the penalty area and a minute later substitute Jimmy Quiggin chipped over Harris's bar with Halesowen well in control.</p>
