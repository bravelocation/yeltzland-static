        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz completed a pretty successful sequence of friendlies with a 1-1 draw at Stourport on Friday night, our goal coming from Leadbetter in another game of multiple substitutions. We've had some good results over the pre-season period and all in all things are looking reasonably promising for the months ahead.</p>
  <p>So on Saturday the season proper finally kicks off with a home game at The Grove againast  <a href="http://www.pvr.co.uk/wings/">Welling United</a> . They finished just 3 points out of the relegation zone last year, but who knows how good they'll be this year. Let's hope for a good start and three points.</p>
