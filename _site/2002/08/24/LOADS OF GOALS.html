        <h1>LOADS OF GOALS</h1>
        <h2>Grantham 3 Yeltz 3</h2>
        <h3>24 August 2002</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>In another game of fluctuating fortunes, the Yeltz took the first point off Grantham in a 3-3 draw.</p>
  <p>We took the lead through an early penalty from  <b>Jason Burnham</b>  after Leadbetter was brought down. We were soon 2-1 down however, equalised through  <b>Les</b> , and then ended up 3-2 down at the end of an exciting first half. The goal fest continued straight after the break with another equaliser from  <b>Jimmy Quiggan</b>  and despite both teams having several chances in some awful weather that was the end of the scoring.</p>
  <p>On Monday we play  <a href="http://www.staffordrangers.co.uk/"&gt;Stafford Rangers</a>  at The Grove in a game it would be really nice to win, and then on Saturday we travel to Biillericay where  <a href="http://www.chelmsfordcityfc.com/"&gt;Chelmsford</a>  play their games.</p>
  <p>For  <b>Fantasy Island players</b> , please note that if either you haven't started playing the game or you're still using an out of date email address,  <b>you will be removed from the game after next Saturday</b> . Don't say you haven't been warned.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Grantham Town: Ziccardi; Wenlock, Dye, McDaid, George, Wilkins, Marshall, Bull (J. Clarke 77), Ranshaw (Wilson 77), Neil (Hallows 84), Hall. Unused Subs: Foster, Hallcro</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: T. Clarke; Colwell, Burnham (Reece 56), Smith, L. Collins, Skidmore, Quiggin (Newall 62), Leadbeater, Elmes, Taylor, Hines. Unused Subs: Spencer, Ashby, Garvey</p>
  <p>Booked: Wilkins (7) Referee: P. T. McCaul (St. Ives, Cambs.)Attendance: 518</p>
  <p>The two newly promoted sides shared six goals in an exciting encounter full of goal-scoring opportunities. However, five goals scored away from the Grove in a week has resulted in only one point gained and manager Brendan Phillips will surely seek an improvement on the three goals scored by Grantham from set pieces.</p>
  <p>Grantham won their first corner after just 10 seconds but Jim Neil's kick was grabbed by Tim Clarke. Halesowen's first attempt came when Jason Burnham hit a 25-yard free-kick well over the bar after 4 minutes. The Yeltz went ahead after 7 minutes when Lee Collins pumped a long ball up the field to find Richard Leadbeater clear on goal - although looking suspiciously offside. Ian Wilkins pushed Leadbeater in the back in the penalty area and the referee had no hesitation in awarding a penalty and giving a yellow card to Wilkins. *b*BURNHAM*cb* stepped up to crash the penalty into the centre of Mario Ziccardi's net.</p>
  <p>Grantham equalised in the 24th minute after Les Hines turned away a cross from Neil and from the Neil's resulting corner DARREN DYE firmly planted a header into Tim Clarke's net. Three minutes later Halesowen's defence was in trouble again from another corner by Gary Bull but Brendan McDaid's header was scrambled clear.</p>
  <p>The visitors fell behind in the 29th minute after Stuart Skidmore bundled over Bull right on the edge of the area and NEIL cracked the direct free-kick straight into the bottom corner of the net with Clarke left standing.</p>
  <p>An open game continued to produce chances at both ends in a great advertisement for Dr. Martens football. On the half-hour Rob Elmes headed a cross from Hines into Zaccardi's arms and in the 35th Jimmy Quiggin missed an open goal when he volleyed a Burnham cross over from just 8 yards out when completely unmarked. Bull then missed an open goal by drilling wide at the opposite end when Collins allowed a long clearance to bounce over his head to leave the striker all alone in front of goal.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen enjoying a good deal of possession on a large pitch it was Grantham's turn to scramble clear in the 41st minute with Stuart Skidmore trying to find the final touch after Elmes headed on Burnham's long throw-in. A minute later Halesowen were back on terms when Elmes headed down a Quiggin cross for *b*HINES*cb* to drive home from 12 yards out.</p>
  <p>The joy was short-lived as Grantham regained the lead on the stroke of half-time when BULL glanced home a right-wing corner against a static Halesowen defence.</p>
  <p>It took Halesowen just two minutes of the second half to claim the final goal of the game and earn a point with *b*QUIGGIN*cb* firing home from a left-wing cross with Grantham's defence guilty of sloppy play.</p>
  <p>The arrival of torrential rain dried up any further goals although both defences were guilty of further mistakes. A poor clearance from Collins almost let in Bull after 54 minutes but the ball rebounded kindly for Tim Clarke. Full-back Steve Wenlock then made two dreadful back-passes to put goalkeeper Zaccardi in trouble. After 68 minutes Wenlock let in Elmes but in a one-on-one on the goalkeeper the chance was lost when Elmes tried to pass across goal to Leadbeater. Two minutes later another terrible back-pass by Wenlock let in Hines, but his cross was cleared for a corner by Danny George with Elmes advancing and Zaccardi again stranded off his line.</p>
  <p>Grantham made three late substitutions and applied pressure in the final minutes in search of a winner. Dominic Hallows volleyed over a Jamie Clarke cross after 86 minutes and the visiting defence escaped again a minute later when Tim Clarke missed his punch from a Stuart Wilson corner. Grantham then had a 90th minute penalty appeal turned down when Jamie Clarke hit the ball against substitute Dominic Reece. The Yeltz defence then hacked clear a 91st minute corner when Clarke lost his way with the ball bobbling around in the area.</p>
