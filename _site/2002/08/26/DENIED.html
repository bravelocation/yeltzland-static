        <h1>DENIED</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 1 Stafford 1</h2>
        <h3>26 August 2002</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz are still looking for their first victory after Stafford Rangers earned a 1-1 draw with a late equaliser at The Grove on Monday night.</p>
  <p>
    We took the lead just before half time through  and looked like we were going to do it until they scored late on in the 85th minute. That leaves us with a disappointing three points from the first four games and in  in the table. &#xD;
	Looking at that table shows we've played the top two so maybe things aren't too bad, so let's keep positive.

  <p>Halesowen seemed on course to hold on for a narrow morale-boosting first win until &#xD;
			they conceded a late goal directly from another set piece.</p>
  <p>Stafford made the livelier start with the impressive David Berks firing &#xD;
			in a 4th minute low drive which was grabbed by goalkeeper &#xD;
			Tim Clarke before Richard Colwell turned a 7th minute cross away with &#xD;
			Rob Heath lurking free in space. Berks then made an excellent 13th &#xD;
			minute run but his chip shot was collected by Clarke.</p>
  <p>With both sides lacking inspiration in the final third of the field, &#xD;
			Halesowen's first real effort came when Richard Leadbeater hit a 25-yard &#xD;
			drive over the bar in the 19th minute following a knock down by Rob Elmes. &#xD;
			Substitute Dominic Reece, replacing the injured Les Hines, hit a Jason Burnham &#xD;
			free-kick just past the post six minutes later. An overhead kick from Collins &#xD;
			was then just tipped away by goalkeeper Ryan Price from under the bar after &#xD;
			Reece earned a 35th minute corner. Stafford's Daniel Davidson beat defender &#xD;
			Neil Smith in the 40th minute to set up Robin Gibson but he curled his effort &#xD;
			wide of the mark.</p>
  <p>
    Halesowen took the lead a minute before the break when Reece worked well &#xD;
			down the left wing and his cross to Elmes let in  to scoop &#xD;
			the ball home from 8 yards out.
    
      <b>JIMMY QUIGGIN</b>
    
  </p>
  <p>The home side never really looked like adding to their goal tally in the &#xD;
			second half although Elmes flashed a corner from Mark Taylor over the bar in &#xD;
			the 58th minute and Skidmore drove wide after 73 minutes. Jason Ashby came on &#xD;
			as a substitute for his first outing of the season to replace the injured &#xD;
			Leadbeater but it was Halesowen's defence that was kept increasingly busy as &#xD;
			the game wore on. Berks produced a 25-yard shot which was turned away for a &#xD;
			corner by Clarke in the 75th minute and Halesowen then desperately defended &#xD;
			two corners despite introducing John Newall to bolster the defence.</p>
  <p>Stafford eventually equalised five minutes from time when Skidmore &#xD;
			needlessly conceded a free-kick on the edge of the penalty area and BERKS &#xD;
			curled the free-kick directly past the suspect Halesowen defensive wall &#xD;
			leaving goalkeeper Clarke standing.</p>
