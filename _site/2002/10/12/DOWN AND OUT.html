        <h1>DOWN AND OUT</h1>
        <h2>FAC  Moor Green 3 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>12 October 2002</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Despite taking an early lead through Jason Ashby, the Yeltz crashed out of the FA Cup in a hotly disputed game at Moor Green.</p>
  <p>According to  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/"&gt;what you lot are saying</a>  the ref was abysmal, giving them two dubious penalties, us hundreds of bookings and sending Lee Collins off for nothing. Not a good day, and a real downer after the excitement of Tuesday. I'm sure there will be loads more discussion on  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/"&gt;YeltzTalk</a>  about the game.</p>
  <p>Of course losing in the Cup meant we missed out on the substantial prize money that's on offer for winners of each round. This makes even more relevant last week's  <a href="/news/pressrelease20021011.asp"&gt;press release from the club</a>  about how they would like to restructure the board to promote external investment.</p>
  <p>Tuesday takes us back to Stourport Swifts in the Worcester Senior Cup, before Saturday's long trip down to  <a href="http://www.forumco.com/weymouthfc/default.asp"&gt;Weymouth</a>  in the league.</p>
