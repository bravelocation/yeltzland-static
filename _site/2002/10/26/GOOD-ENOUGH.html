        <h1>GOOD ENOUGH</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 0 Worcester 0</h2>
        <h3>26 October 2002</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>After the recent goal-fests, the mighty Yeltz got back to not scoring at The Grove. However by keeping a clean sheet we earned a creditable 0-0 draw with league leaders Worcester. It was an exciting encounter with both keepers making some good saves. Full details in the  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=26102002"&gt;match reports</a> .</p>
  <p>We meet  <a href="http://www.worcestercityfc.org.uk/"&gt;Worcester</a>  again on Monday, this time at their place in the League Cup before  <a href="http://www.bathcityfc.com/"&gt;Bath</a>  visit The Grove next Saturday in the FA Trophy. After the stuffing we got down there, it will be interesting to see how much we've improved since then, and it would be nice to have a decent run in the Trophy for once.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Hines, Smith, Stone, Newall, Skidmore, Ashby, May, Master (Reece 90), R. Collins. Unused Subs: Leadbeater, Quiggin, Garvey</p>
  <p>Worcester City: McDonnell; Davies, Jones, Heeley, Holloway, Snape, Middleton, Lyons, Owen (Carty 67), Webster, Holmes. Unused Subs: Willetts, McDonald, Parker, Wyatt</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Henry (Northampton) Attendance: 803 Booked: Stone (52)</p>
  <p>Halesowen's improved form was maintained in an end-to-end encounter that ended all square against league leaders Worcester City. Gavin Stone was given a home debut due to the suspension of Lee Collins and went on to be named man-of-the-match in a faultless display at the heart of the Halesowen defence.</p>
  <p>Ross Collins put Kirk Master free to shoot weakly at former-Yeltz goalkeeper Danny McDonnell in the 3rd minute and four minutes later Master touched a free-kick to Les Hines but his effort was deflected for a corner-kick that Ross Collins headed just high.</p>
  <p>Adam Webster broke for Worcester in the 9th minute and he crossed for Darren Middleton to miscue his shot, although the ball then looped dangerously with Tim Clarke having to touch the ball onto the top of the crossbar. Halesowen's acting captain Richard Colwell found Master in the 13th minute with a delightful through ball but McDonnell was able to block from close range. Master then took advantage of a slip by visiting defender Allan Davies and his 18-yard shot was grabbed at the second attempt by McDonnell. Worcester's Webster then headed against the far post after 26 minutes and fired a shot at Clarke as the game continued to swing from end to end.</p>
  <p>On the half-hour Master sent over a dangerous cross that eluded the Worcester defence but Leroy May was inches from connecting. Carl Heeley was then forced to concede a corner after a surging run from Jason Ashby. Stone made a fine 39th minute interception and sent Stuart Skidmore on a break up the field and he in turn set up May to drive at McDonnell from 15 yards. Just before half-time Hines played a wing-to-wing ball to Colwell and his cross was grasped at full stretch by McDonnell, with May set to pounce.</p>
  <p>The second half continued at a lightning pace with David Holmes weaving himself into a good position before shooting wide from 20 yards for the visitors. Another dangerous Master cross drifted inches wide after 55 minutes and two minutes later May put a free header just wide from a Hines cross. Clarke grabbed a right-wing corner at the second attempt with the help of Ross Collins after 59 minutes and on the hour Ashby turned his defender John Holloway but chipped just over the bar. A great 64th minute break then saw Webster break free of John Newall before pushing his 15-yard shot inches wide of Clarke's post.</p>
  <p>Clarke preserved Halesowen's point with a series of late saves. In the 75th minute the injured Clarke made a great reflex stop from Middleton and when the rebound fell to Webster the loud appeals for a penalty due to a tackle from behind were denied. Halesowen then went close themselves when Ashby crossed to Collins but the ball was blocked on the line and Colwell embarked on a solo run from his own defence but he elected to shoot weakly at McDonnell. From Worcester's counter-attack Webster poked a Pat Lyons volley just past the post.</p>
  <p>Three minutes from time Clarke made another great fingertip save from Carty's deflected volley.</p>
