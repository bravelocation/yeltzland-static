  <p>I think we can definitely say we've turned the season around. In an unbelieveably exciting FA Trophy tie, we beat Bath 4-3 after they had twice come from behind to level.</p>
  <p>We took an early lead through the increasingly influential  <b>Jason Ashby</b> , but they equalised before half-time. We retook the lead through  <b>Colwell</b>  just after the break, and after  <b>Ashby</b>  made it 3-1 not long after it was looking very good. However, they soon got one back, and then made it 3-3 before  <b>Rob Elmes</b>  got the winner to take us through to the second round. Hurrah! As ever, read  DJ's match report  for full details on the match.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us back to league action with an important game at  <a href="http://www.havantandwaterlooville.net/">Havant</a> . Although we're five games unbeaten now we're still in a precarious position so it's important we keep the run going against a team that was fancied to compete for the title before the season began.</p>
