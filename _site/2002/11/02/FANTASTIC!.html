  <p>I think we can definitely say we've turned the season around. In an unbelieveably exciting FA Trophy tie, we beat Bath 4-3 after they had twice come from behind to level.</p>
  <p>
    We took an early lead through the increasingly influential , but they equalised before half-time. We retook the lead through  just after the break, and after  made it 3-1 not long after it was looking very good. However, they soon got one back, and then made it 3-3 before  got the winner to take us through to the second round. Hurrah! As ever, read  for full details on the match.
