        <h3>12 November 2002</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz moved through to the last 16 of the B'ham Senior Cup with an easy victory over Alliance team Studley. Goals from  <b>Leroy</b> ,  <b>Reece</b>  and  <b>Big Rich</b>  sent the meagre crowd of 212 home as happy as a Halesowen crowd gets.</p>
  <p>According to the  <a href="http://www.thenon-leaguepaper.com/news/index.php?newsmode=FULL&amp;nid=7055&amp;start_from=0">Non-League Paper</a> , we're close to signing  <b>Phil Trainer</b> , a young midfielder who's previously played for Crewe.</p>
  <p>Saturday's game at home to struggling  <a href="http://www.folkestoneinvicta.co.uk/">Folkestone</a>  is obviously very important, so let's hope for three points!</p>

  <p>Halesowen booked their place in the last sixteen of the Birmingham Senior Cup with a comfortable win over Midland Alliance Studley FC.</p>
  <p>The visitors stunned the Halesowen defence in the 4th minute when a diving header from Mark Beddowes hit the post. Almost immediately Kirk Master replied by cracking a 25-yard effort against the Studley woodwork at the Stourbridge Road end with Leroy May hitting the rebound high. A 13th minute shot from Ian Mitchell then brought a flying save out of Tim Clarke.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz took a 21st minute lead with MAY heading home a right wing corner from Master. Mitchell drove wide in the 29th minute for Studley but Halesowen went two goals ahead in the 35th minute through Dominic REECE with a 20-yard direct free-kick after Steve Hands had brought down John Newall on the edge of the box.</p>
  <p>Half-time substitute Rob Elmes put a 52nd minute free header wide of the mark from Richard Colwell's cross but a minute later Elmes forced a blocking save from Danny Lewis. Master then planted a firm header in the path of Reece for the full-back to fire a fierce shot at Lewis. Lewis made another fine save from Master's 18-yard shot in the 75th minute.</p>
  <p>Studley enjoyed a fair proportion of second-half possession and had a good chance to pull a goal back in the 81st minute when Mark Crisp hit against the bar from 10-yards but substitute Kevin Rowlands then blasted the rebound high from in front of goal.</p>
  <p>Halesowen added a third goal in the 87th minute when Lewis failed to hold a shot from the right by Master leaving substitute Richard LEADBEATER with a simple tap-in. On full-time, Master broke from his own half and set up Elmes but the striker completely missed the target with the goal at his mercy.</p>
