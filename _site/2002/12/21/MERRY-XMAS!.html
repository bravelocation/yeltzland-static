        <h1>MERRY XMAS!</h1>
        <h2>Hinckley 1 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>21 December 2002</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Not quite the present we were hoping for, but the mighty Yeltz gained another point in our fight for survival with a 1-1 draw at Hinckley. A first half goal from Skidder was cancelled out by an equaliser early in the second half, but by all accounts we had the better of the game and deserved more.</p>
  <p>Boxing Day takes us to high-flying Stafford, and then Hastings visit The Grove next Saturday.</p>
  <p>I'm off on my holidays at the weekend so updates to the site will be a bit slower than usual until after the New Year. Merry Xmas to all of you out there, and hopefully I'll see many of you at Dover on January 4th.</p>

  <p>Halesowen put up a gutsy performance to earn a point at draw-specialists Hinckley but could have returned with more in a game they dominated on a heavily-sanded surface.</p>
  <p>This was Halesowen's first visit to Middlefield Lane since the 10th April 1986 when 274 spectators watched the Yeltz win by a lone goal just a fortnight before the last trip to Wembley.</p>
  <p>Richard Colwell fed Stuart Skidmore overlapping down the right in the 4th minute but his cross went along the face of goal. Two minutes later Colwell then sprayed a pass out to the left for Kirk Master to cut in and fire a 25-yard shot against the base of the post with goalkeeper Tommy Whittle beaten.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz went ahead in the 18th minute when Jason Ashby chased and won a long ball near the bye-line and waited to play a perfect pass into the path of SKIDMORE for the battling midfielder to plant a 20-yard strike into the top corner of the net. Lee Collins then powered a 26th minute over the bar before Chris Adamson came into the action by collecting a long-range effort from David Sadler a minute later. Ashby then bravely charged down a Whittle clearance in the 32nd minute but luckily for the Hinckley defence the ball broke for a throw-in. On 37 minutes Hinckley skipper Andy Penney headed down a long cross but Adamson beat Chris Smith to the ball. Adamson then tipped a Scott Voice header over the bar as the home side won two corners. A minute before half-time Hinckley cleared a left-wing corner but the ball fell for Colwell to hit a dipping shot that was tipped away for a corner by Whittle.</p>
  <p>The Knitters levelled four minutes into the second half when substitute Martin Fox touched a free-kick for VOICE to drive past the wall and beyond Adamson from 20 yards out. A 58th minute cross from Stuart Storer then gave Voice a free header but Adamson saved low down.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finished strongly and dominated the final half-hour but could not find a winning goal. On the hour a 25-yard shot from Master along the ground was turned away for a corner by Whittle and four minutes later Neil Smith latched onto a cleared corner with a 25-yard strike which looked goal-bound before striking the Hinckley crossbar. On 67 minutes Ashby beat his marker and squared for Master but his shot was cleared off the line. Master then floated in a 75th minute free-kick and Gavin Stone ghosted in at the far post but hit over from close range whilst in the 77th minute substitute Leroy May put a long cross wide of the mark in front of goal.</p>
  <p>At the other end Voice hit straight at Adamson in the 83rd minute and Dyer just failed to connect with a Sadler cross. A minute later Whittle turned away a Phil Trainer shot for the first of two corners but Hinckley held on for a point to record their fourth successive draw.</p>
