        <h2>Yeltz 2 Hastings 1</h2>
        <h3>28 December 2002</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz finished off the year with a much needed 2-1 victory against Hastings. A first half goal from Jason and a winner from Big Rich means we go into 2003  just above the relegation zone  in in very tight bottom half of the table.</p>
  <p>On New Year's Day we welcome  <a href="http://www.newport-county.co.uk/">Newport County</a>  to Fortress Grove in another game we'll be hoping for maximum points in.</p>
  <p>I'm still off on my holidays all week so updates to the site will be a bit slower than usual I'm afraid. Have a very happy New Year, and hopefully I'll see many of you at Dover on January 4th.</p>
