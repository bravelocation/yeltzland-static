  <p>After some very wet weather, it wasn't much surprise when the game against Newport was called off because of a waterlogged pitch. This hasn't affected our position in the table at all as only one game managed to escape the bad weather.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us - weather permitting - all the way to  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/doverbhoy/">Dover</a>  in what could be a difficult game, although we gave them a good match at The Grove earlier in the season. Regarding my previous note saying that Margate play at Dover this season, it turns out they were back at "home" last week. Anyhoo, let's hope the pitch will be OK and the game will be on.</p>
