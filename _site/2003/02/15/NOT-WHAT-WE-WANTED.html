        <h2>Crawley 4 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>15 February 2003</h3>

  <p>We travelled in hope of a point but ended up being completely overrun by a half-decent team.</p>
  <p>Actually the result is a bit flattering to them. We had the better of the first half despite being one down to a rubbish goal, but when we went 2-0 it was really all over. Two more very poor goals from rubbish defending plus a sending off for Asa Charlton meant our mini-revival was emphatically over, and with Weymouth winning again we're now  5 points from safety .</p>
  <p>I'm sure you've all seen that the  <b>League Cup semi-final against Chippenham at The Grove has been arranged at short notice for Tuesday</b> , so make sure you let everyone know. It's going to be tough but our cup form has been excellent this year so let's hope for the best.</p>
