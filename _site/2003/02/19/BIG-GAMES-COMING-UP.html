  <p>With the freezing weather cancelling the League Cup semi-final against Chippenham (provisionally rearranged for March 4th), we need to pick up some points in the League very quickly.</p>
  <p>We've got an excellent chance to do just that, with the next 3 games against Chelmsford and Weymouth at The Grove and then Ilkeston away. We can, and probably must, take 9 points from those games, so it's really the crucial part of what's been a difficult season so far. However I've still got every confidence we can do it. Come on!</p>
