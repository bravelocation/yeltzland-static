    After the recent disappointments, it's great to report a victory against a poor Ilkeston side who look certain to go down. Goals from  (he scored for Bradford against the Albion in the Cup), a McHugh penalty ( - thanks to Chris Davis) and a third from Jason has at least kept us within some sort of reach of safety.

  <p>However, we've got the distraction of a League Cup semi-final against Chips'n'ham on Tuesday. It would be great to beat them, but it really is a case of concentrating on the league at the moment.</p>
