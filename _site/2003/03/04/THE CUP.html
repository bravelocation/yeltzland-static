        <p>
  <p>Despite our poor league form we've been mostly excellent in Cups this season, and we continued in that vein to reach the League Cup final through a 2-1 victory against Chippenham. After going behind in the first half, we came back through 2 pens from Fraser McHugh to earn a well-deserved victory.</p>
  <p>The final will be against Crawley, but I'm not sure about the format yet - never paid much attention to the competition this far to be honest. I'm sure someone will let me know.</p>
  <p>More good news tonight when relegation rivals Hastings lost at Bath, and if we can beat Cambridge on Saturday we'll be right back in the thick of things. Let's hope we can take some confidence from tonight into the rest of the season.</p>
