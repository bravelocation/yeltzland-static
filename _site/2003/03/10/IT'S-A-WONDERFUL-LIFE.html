        <h2>Dover 0 Yeltz 3</h2>
        <h3>10 March 2003</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>In a fantastic and totally unexpected way, we're right back in with a chance of staying up after a stunning 3-0 victory away at Dover. Another goal from Mark Danks followed by two from Frazer (one a penalty) hasn't moved us up  the table  but we're now only in the bottom four on goal difference - which has been much-improved tonight.</p>
  <p>Another tough game on Saturday when we visit 2nd place  <a href="http://www.chippenhamtownfc.co.uk/">Chippenham</a> . Now obviously we beat them in the Cup last week so we must have a chance, and let's hope we can continue our excellent run of late and pick up another point or three.</p>
