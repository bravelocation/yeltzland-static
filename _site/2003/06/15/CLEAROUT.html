        <h3>15 June 2003</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>It's been pretty quiet so far - it is only June after all - but there's been quite a few players let go from the squad that got us relegated last year.</p>
  <p>I believe the following players not been resigned: Lee Collins, Les Hines, Gavin Stone, Richard Leadbeater,Tim Clarke, Neil Gibson, Gary Bauress, Mark Danks, Michael Blackwood, Lee Williams, Kirk Master.</p>
  <p>Signed so far:  <b>Mark Hallam</b> , a forward from Tamworth and  <b>Lee Knight</b>  back from Redditch with a lot more to come (otherwise we've only got about 9 players). More news on  YeltzTalk  as people find out about it.</p>
  <p>According to Chas, the pre-season friendlies announced so far are Alfreton h July 19, Hednesford h Aug 5th, Willenhall a Aug 9th plus Bradford City, Blues, Oldbury no dates asy yet. Again, more when things have been confirmed.</p>
  <p>On the pyramid reorganisation, it will all be ratified on June 20th, but it looks at the moment like the top 7 of the Western Divison will help make up the new Southern Premier the season after, which you would really hope we can do. Could be a bit of a dull season ahead though.</p>
