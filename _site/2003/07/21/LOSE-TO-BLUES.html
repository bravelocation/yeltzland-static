        <h3>21 July 2003</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Another reasonable performance in a pre-season friendly, this time a 2-1 loss against a Birmingham City XI managed by ex-yeltz boss Stewart Hall. As usual, full details in  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=21072003"&gt;DJ's match report</a> .</p>
  <p>Next game is at Oldbury on Thursday, which should be a cracker :-)</p>
  <p>I've been doing a few bits of housekeeping on the site over the summer, and have a few things to come over the next few months. However two things I'd like to point out are these. This season's election for the  <a href="/haveyoursay/halloffame/"&gt;Yeltz Hall of Fame</a>  is now open. Also,  <a href="/haveyoursay/fantasyisland/"&gt;Fantasy Island</a>  is ready to go with the start of the league games, so you can start entering your predictions in for any games that are within the next month.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Harris; Colwell, Charlton, Kavanagh (Trainer 55), Smith (J. &#xD;
Skidmore HT), Grocutt (Small HT), Hollis (Wray HT), Mitchell (Phillips HT), &#xD;
Hallam (Ashby HT), Blake (Spencer 55), March. Sub: Gayle</p>
  <p>Birmingham City XI: Dormand; Cotterill, Vaughan, Painter, Arrowsmith, Alsop, &#xD;
Till, Allen, Fagan, Borrowman, Motteram. Subs: Longthorn, Bagnall, Sheppard, &#xD;
O'Brian, Birley, Parratt</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Mariner</p>
  <p>Ex-Halesowen manager Stewart Hall brought his pacy youngsters to the Grove &#xD;
but it was Halesowen's Leon Mitchell who hit inches wide in the 4th minute &#xD;
after turning defender Lee Vaughan with a clever back-heel. Mark Hallam's &#xD;
header then produced a reflex save from James Dormond in the 10th minute.</p>
  <p>City went ahead after 21 minutes through Andy Borrowman who slotted into an &#xD;
empty net when young goalkeeper Matt Harris raced off his line but &#xD;
completely missed his attempted headed clearance of a long ball. With the &#xD;
visitors on top, Craig Fagan struck the side-netting from a good position on &#xD;
the half-hour before Peter Till lashed home a second goal in the 44th minute &#xD;
as Halesowen's defence failed to clear a corner.</p>
  <p>Borrowman then hit the underside of the Halesowen bar from 5 yards straight &#xD;
after the break and Richard Colwell made a timely clearance from Fagan in &#xD;
the 73rd minute.</p>
  <p>Jason Ashby pulled a goal back with a simple tap-in after 76 minutes when &#xD;
goalkeeper Dormond dropped a Jamie March cross and four minutes later Andy &#xD;
Spencer cracked just wide as Halesowen finished more strongly.</p>
