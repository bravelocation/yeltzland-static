        <h2>Yeltz 6 Bedworth 3</h2>
        <h3>08 November 2003</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>In an exciting game at The Grove, the mighty Yeltz came out 6-3 winners against struggling Bedworth, although we left it late to clinch the three points.  <b>Hat-tricks from Jason Ashby and Leon Mitchell</b>  meant we've climbed to  5th in the table , but it was 3-3 until the 84th minute so it wasn't as easy as it sounds. Full details as usual in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we're finally getting to play the League Cup First Round tie at Bromsgrove, before bottom-placed Shepshed visit The Grove on Saturday.</p>

  <p>Jason Ashby and Leon Mitchell both completed late hat-tricks at the goals-galore &#xD;
Grove in a game Halesowen controlled but almost threw away.</p>
  <p>Halesowen poured forward from the start and the writing was on the wall for &#xD;
Bedworth in the 3rd minute when James Richardson headed a dangerous &#xD;
cross from Richard Colwell behind his own goal for a corner. Lewis Baker headed &#xD;
just wide and Ben Steane shot weakly at former Yeltz goalkeeper Gary Hateley in &#xD;
the 5th minute. Andy Spencer was put clear by Simon Hollis in the &#xD;
15th minute but could only flick the ball into the arms of Hateley &#xD;
and a 19th minute header from Darren Grocutt fell onto the top of the &#xD;
Bedworth net.</p>
  <p>The opening Halesowen goal finally arrived in the 35th minute with &#xD;
MITCHELL heading home a Hollis cross after Ashby held up the ball near the &#xD;
goal-line. Two minutes later ASHBY increased the lead by turning home Spencer's &#xD;
cross off the inside of the post.</p>
  <p>With more goals looking imminent Hollis hit a spectacular 39th minute &#xD;
volley at Hateley from Mitchell's cross and Baker headed a Steane corner high. &#xD;
On the stroke of half-time Spencer's 20-yard shot drifted wide and Mitchell hit &#xD;
a great chance high over the bar and down the Stourbridge Road from just 8 yards &#xD;
out.</p>
  <p>The in-form Hateley produced a fine reflex save to deny Ashby from five yards &#xD;
immediately after the re-start as it seemed the floodgates were about to open. &#xD;
But Bedworth pulled a goal back two minutes after the break when Kevin CHARLEY &#xD;
burst through the Halesowen defence to fire past Matt Lowe from 18 yards in &#xD;
their first real attempt on goal.</p>
  <p>ASHBY restored the two-goal advantage three minutes later from the penalty spot &#xD;
after Ben Steane was tugged back in the area. Mitchell then saw his stunning &#xD;
20-yard shot tipped over for a corner by the busy Hateley in the 54th &#xD;
minute.</p>
  <p>The plucky visitors mounted another unlikely comeback to equalise with two &#xD;
further goals in four minutes. Martin Crowley's 58th minute free-kick &#xD;
was turned away by Lowe and Kirk Smith hit the loose ball against the bar &#xD;
leaving CHARLEY to slot home into the empty net. The Yeltz defence was caught &#xD;
napping again when substitute Darren MASSINGHAM headed home through a crowd of &#xD;
players directly from a right wing corner in the 62nd minute.</p>
  <p>
    
      <P>Just when a draw seemed on the cards Halesowen's potent attack produced three &#xD;
late goals. Hateley rushed out of his area in the 84th minute but was &#xD;
beaten to the ball by the pacy MITCHELL who side-stepped the goalkeeper before &#xD;
curling a superb 20-yard shot into the unprotected net. MITCHELL completed a &#xD;
fine hat-trick in the 88th minute by latching onto a long ball from &#xD;
Hollis before crashing past Hateley. ASHBY completed the party to notch his own &#xD;
hat-trick and 19th goal of the season in the final minute when a deft &#xD;
back-heel from Steane put him clear to stroke home with the Bedworth defence in &#xD;
tatters.</P>
