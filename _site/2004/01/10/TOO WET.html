        <h1>TOO WET</h1>
        <h2>Cinderford P Yeltz P</h2>
        <h3>10 January 2004</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The recent wet weather caused the game down in Cinderford to be called off. However it wasn't too bad a day with several other results going our way somewhat.</p>
  <p>Despite Redditch only drawing and Gloucester losing again, we're down to  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=10012004">5th in the table</a>  with Cirencester looking the main hope to catch Redditch at the moment. They lost their first 4 games, so it's been an amazing run of 12 wins and 2 draws since.</p>
  <p>We start a run of 4 home games on Tuesday against lowly Rushall Olympic in the B'ham Senior Cup before Swindon Supermarine visit The Grove on Saturday.</p>
