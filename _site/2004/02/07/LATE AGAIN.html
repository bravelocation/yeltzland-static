  <p>Halesowen deserved their slender victory but had to wait for an own-goal two &#xD;
minutes from time in order to break the stalemate. With experienced central &#xD;
defender Colin Hoyle making his debut the Yeltz looked far more composed at the &#xD;
back than of late with Solihull proving to be ineffective in attack.</p>
  <p>
    In early exchanges Mark Sheils clawed away an 8 minute corner from &#xD;
Dave Haywood and two minutes later Andy Spencer volleyed just over Mark Gayle's &#xD;
crossbar at the other end. Jason Ashby then chipped a loose ball over the &#xD;
Solihull bar after Richard Ball charged down a 16 minute clearance.

    Former Yeltz goalkeeper Gayle saved an 18 minute snapshot from Andy &#xD;
Spencer and Ball then wasted a good pass down the right from full-back Richard &#xD;
Colwell a minute later with Halesowen making the most of playing with a gusty &#xD;
wind behind them in the first half.

    Asa Charlton rattled the stanchion behind the goal with a 28 minute &#xD;
free-kick after Spencer was brought down on the edge of the Solihull area. Simon &#xD;
Hollis then hit a 30-yard free-kick against the Solihull defensive wall and in &#xD;
the 39 minute Gayle made a fine save to deny Hollis after he picked &#xD;
up a pass from Colwell before side-stepping his marker to shoot.

  <p>Five minutes before the break Solihull's best chance of the game fell to Paul &#xD;
Hunter when he flew past centre-half Dan Jones and cut-in from the left but he &#xD;
blasted high from just 8 yards out. Jones then headed another Charlton free-kick &#xD;
just wide for the hosts a few seconds before the interval.</p>
  <p>
    Morton Titteron curled just wide for Solihull at the start of the second half &#xD;
but it was Halesowen who continued to create most chances in the second half. &#xD;
Ball broke free on the right but lashed high on 67 minutes and David Foy hit a &#xD;
speculative 25-yard shot wide of the mark a minute later. Ben Steane produced a &#xD;
moment of midfield magic in the 70 minute allowing Spencer to cross &#xD;
but the Solihull defence scrambled clear from Ashby in front of goal. Ashby then &#xD;
latched onto a long ball from defence in the 71 minute but then &#xD;
lost control before Ball crashed a shot wide.

    Hunter headed a 76 minute free-kick from Haywood into the arms of &#xD;
Sheils before Halesowen's Steane made another surging run but shot directly at &#xD;
Gayle with five minutes remaining.

  <p>With the game heading for deadlock Halesowen claimed a winner with just two &#xD;
minutes remaining. Steane cleverly side-stepped the ball in midfield allowing &#xD;
Foy to play the ball out to Hollis and when he volleyed across goal Martin HIER &#xD;
turned the ball into his own net from close range as he attempted to clear.</p>
