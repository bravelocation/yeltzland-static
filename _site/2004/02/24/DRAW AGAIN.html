  <p>The mighty Yeltz again failed to beat struggling Shepshed, and missed out on a chance to significantly close the &#xD;
&#xD;
gap on leaders Redditch.</p>
  <p>
    We took the lead in the first half through Forsdick, but they soon equalised and then took the lead halfway &#xD;
&#xD;
through the second half, before Alfie Carter got a late equaliser. It's moved us up to , but 12 points behind the leaders with only two games in hand now.

    Saturday takes us to second placed  in a crucial game at &#xD;
&#xD;
the top of the league. Redditch won here last week, so I suspect if we're going to catch them we're going to have to do the &#xD;
&#xD;
same. However, we've done well against the top teams this season, so let's hope we can do it.
