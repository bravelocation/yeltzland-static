        <h1>JUST THE LEAGUE NOW</h1>
        <h2>WSC  Worcester 3 Yeltz 2 (AET)</h2>
        <h3>01 March 2004</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>We can fully concentrate on the league now, as The Yeltz were knocked out of their last cup competition last night. Despite coming back from two down with goals from Craig Strachan and Jason Moore (as he's known now), we lost 3-2 in extra time at Worcester in the WSC.</p>
  <p>
    It's very good that Jason got back on the scoresheet again, and let's hope he can score again at  on Saturday. We really have got all to play for still, but we can't afford any more slip-ups now. There are 12 games to go, and winning all of them would take us 87 points (which would have gained !). It's a tall order but we can do it, so come on!
