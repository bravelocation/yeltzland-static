        <h1>BANK HOLIDAY BLUES</h1>
        <h2>Sutton Coldfield 3 Yeltz 1 and Yeltz 0 Bromsgrove 0</h2>
        <h3>12 April 2004</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz's fine run of form came to an abrupt end over the Bank Holiday weekend with two disappointing performances and results against fellow promotion chasing Sutton and Bromsgrove. However we've now guaranteed a top eight finish, and need only four points at most to avoid the play-off spot and ensure we get promotion.</p>
  <p>Saturday's game at Sutton was particularly disappointing, but they played much better than us and fully deserved their victory. By all accounts we were a bit better at home on Monday, but Bromsgrove probably had the better chances.</p>
  <p>At the top of the league Redditch are faltering badly and can now be caught by Gloucester (as they still have to play them). We've got just three games left now, starting with Rugby at The Grove on Saturday.</p>
