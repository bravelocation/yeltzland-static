  <p>After a few weeks off watching the usual disappointing England display, thoughts come around once again to the new season. It's just a couple of weeks until the friendlies start - fixtures now added - and then the excitement of a few new places to visit following the pyramid reorganisation and our entry into the revamped Premier Division. More details when the fixture list comes out.</p>
  <p>It's been reasonably quiet so far on the transfer front, with the most notable signing that of Richard Burgess, a striker from Redditch. Again, all will become a bit clearer after the usual round of triallists playing in the pre-season games.</p>
