        <h1>JUST WARMING UP</h1>
        <h2>Friendly  Evesham 1 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>17 July 2004</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Just four weeks to go until the start of what is going to be a very interesting season, with lots of new opponents due to the long overdue reorganisation of the football pyramid.</p>
  <p>The  fixture list  is out now, starting with a home game against Aylesbury and ending with an away trip to Hitchin.</p>
  <p>We started the friendly season yesterday with a 1-0 loss to Evesham. More news if I receive any, or see Chris's comment in  YeltzTalk .</p>
  <p>We play our regular friendly against the Albion on Wednesday at The Grove, before hosting Worcester City on Saturday.</p>
