        <h2>Friendlies  Chasetown 1 Yeltz 2 - Boldmere 1 Yeltz 6</h2>
        <h3>07 August 2004</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz go into the start of the new season on the back of some promising pre-season performances, and two wins against lower-league opposition.</p>
  <p>On Thursday we beat Chasetown 2-1, before putting six past Boldmere on Saturday in an excellent finish to the summer preliminaries. More details in the various match reports.</p>
  <p>We kick off the new league season with the visit of  <a href="http://www.aylesburyunited.co.uk/">Aylesbury</a>  to The Grove on Saturday. They finished tailed off at the bottom of the Ryman Premier last year, but as with several teams this year it's going to be hard to judge how well we're going to do. However we must be pretty confident we can start off with three points.</p>
  <p>For all those who are still playing, don't forget this is the first game of the new Fantasy Island so don't forget to enter your predictions before the kickoff - there are no excuses!</p>
