  <p>In one of the best games I've seen for ages, the mighty Yeltz clinched their place in the next round of the Cup with an injury-time winner from the brilliant Jimmy Haarhoff.</p>
  <p>They scored early on, but we equalised soon afterwards when Forsdick went on an excellent run, and Jimmy finished off with a great shot in the corner. We then played some of the best football I've seen us play for years and deservedly took the lead through a 25 yard top-corner screamer from Forsdick.</p>
  <p>Second half they came back into it and equalised with a pretty decent goal, but then Nick Preston fell nastily, and apparently swallowed his tounge. After being treated he walked off with assistance but later went to hospital with concussion. Hopefully everything is OK and I'm sure we all wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
  <p>The game carried on and at the end we were pretty happy with a draw, but then Jimmy broke down the left and smacked it into the bottom corner to send us home very happy.</p>
  <p>For those of you like me who haven't seen much of us recently, we are playing excellent entertaining (and winning!) football at the moment, so if you haven't been down The Grove for a while I strongly urge you to come back home - it's just like the old days!!</p>
  <p>Next Saturday we're back in league action at home when Dunstable are the visitors, and we try to gain revenge for our defeat down at their place a few weeks ago.</p>
