  <p>A goal from leading marksman Jimmy Haarhoff was just enough to put Halesowen back on top of the table in their first league double over injury-hit Hednesford since 1988.</p>
  <p>The Pitmen were first to show with Andy Bell's 5th minute overhead kick landing on top of the net and Dan Jones then headed away Anthony Maguire's free-kick for the corner on 11 minutes.</p>
  <p>Haarhoff and Alex Cowley worked Halesowen's first corner on 13 minutes and three minutes later Hednesford goalkeeper Ryan Young produced a tremendous flying save to deny Lewis Baker's header from another Cowley corner. Dan Jones put Jason Moore through with a clear sight on goal on 22 minutes but he scooped over the bar from 15-yards. Haarhoff then fought to win the ball on the left wing in the 27th minute but his cross was just inches too high after a fine weaving run.</p>
  <p>Chris Brindley was given the first of six bookings in the game when he hacked down Haarhoff in the 36th minute and on 38 minutes Moore was put clear again but he hesitated in front of goal and the chance was lost. The Yeltz forced three corners in the 41st minute but Young saved on the line from Nicki Preston's close range header after a flick on from Moore. Just before the interval home goalkeeper Chris Taylor then collected from Brindley and Steve Pope blocked from Maguire.</p>
  <p>Two minutes into the second half a 30-yard free-kick from Pope was deflected for a corner and Cowley struck the side-netting.</p>
  <p>Simon Forsdick set up the decisive goal in the 51st minute by beating four Hednesford players in an inspirational run from midfield before slipping the ball for HAARHOFF on the left to beat Young from a tight angle just inside the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Lee Barrow then cleared from Moore down the left and Young collected another Baker header on the hour. After a period of niggly fouls that resulted in further bookings, Haarhoff put defender Jones free down the right but his shot was blocked and Pope hit a long-range free-kick wide on 70 minutes.</p>
  <p>With time running out for the visitors, Marlon Walters crossed from the right after Preston missed his challenge but Baker somehow managed to clear a goal-bound shot from substitute Steve Anthrobus off the line in the 80th minute. In injury time Andy Bell's shot was tipped away for a corner by goalkeeper Taylor's fingers with Leon McSweeney lurking at the far post.</p>
