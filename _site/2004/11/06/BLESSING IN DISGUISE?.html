        <h1>BLESSING IN DISGUISE?</h1>
        <h2>FAT  Bromsgrove 2 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>06 November 2004</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>Although it's always disappointing to lose, in the big scheme of things maybe it's good that we're not distracted any more from the League? I'm not sure, but in any case we're out of the FA Trophy after losing 2-1 at Bromsgrove. Full details in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>
    Next week we play in the First Round of the FA Cup for a long time when we travel to West London to play Rymans Premier . They're obviously a decent team, but so are we and we've never had such a good opportunity to progress. I'm sure it'll be another great Cup away trip, and if we can at least get into the draw I'll be happy.

  <p>Halesowen fell at the first hurdle in the FA Trophy in a hard fought local derby against battling Bromsgrove.</p>
  <p>Arthur Appleton drove wide for the hosts in the 2nd minute and an Ian Cooper cross was cleared at the other end a minute later. Former Halesowen striker Leon Mitchell then broke clear down the left for the home side in the 8th minute and the ball fell for Ryan Mahon to hit a looping shot onto the crossbar with goalkeeper Chris Taylor beaten.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz won the first corner on 16 minutes and Lewis Baker struck the bar when goalkeeper Matt Lowe lost the ball in a crowded goalmouth after his defence initially cleared from Simon Forsdick. Marcus Jackson blasted at Taylor from the left on 22 minutes but a couple of minutes later Lowe did well to keep out a deflected shot from Forsdick and then saved low down from Alex Cowley.</p>
  <p>After a series of bruising tackles late in the first half, dead-ball specialist Steve Pope saw his 36th minute free-kick from the edge of the area deflected away for a corner.</p>
  <p>Two minutes into the second half Halesowen central defender Dan Jones drove a free-kick into the Bromsgrove area but Lowe collected as Forsdick failed to make a firm contact. Bromsgrove then upset the Premier pacesetters by taking a 49th minute lead in a flowing breakaway up the slope when Nicky CAMPBELL converted Marcus Jackson's right wing cross with a diving header.</p>
  <p>Baker headed just wide at the far post for the visitors on the hour from Dave Haywood's cross and Lowe dived at his post to keep out a 65th minute effort from Niki Preston with his defence scrambling away the resulting corner.</p>
  <p>In pulsating action Appleton scooped over the Halesowen bar from 12 yards in the 67th minute but then APPLETON headed home Bromsgrove's second goal directly from Steve Hillman's right wing free-kick in the 71st minute.</p>
  <p>Halesowen pulled a goal back in the 74th minute when Richard Burgess provided the final close-range touch beyond Lowe after substitute Nick Amos helped on a free-kick but Halesowen made little further impression on the home defence despite two late shots from substitute Ben Steane.</p>
