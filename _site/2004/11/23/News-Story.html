        <h2>BSC  Bedworth 2 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>23 November 2004</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz cleverly managed to relieve themselves of another burden to their league campaign by managing to lose 2-1 to Bedworth in the B'ham Senior Cup. Despite taking the lead through Alex Cowley, they scored two before half-time to clinch the tie.</p>
  <p>In much more important matters, we have a chance to go back to the the top of the table on Saturday when we travel to  <a href="http://www.puritanical.net/">Banbury</a> . With most other teams playing in the Trophy, a win will take us back into first place which would be very nice!</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Ladek, Cooper, Cowley, Preston (c), Amos, Jones, Skidmore (Baker 52), Steane, Haarhoff, Burgess (Moore 65), Lamey (Forsdick 54). Unused Sub: Grocutt</p>
  <p>The Yeltz surprisingly bowed out of their third Cup competition in November to a team a division below them despite taking an early lead. With Chris Taylor given a rest, young goalkeeper Ladek took his up duty between the sticks on his debut after signing earlier in the season from Stourport Swifts. The visitors dominated the opening minutes with crosses into the penalty area from Ian Cooper causing some danger. The early pressure then paid off in the 17th minute when goalkeeper Lee Evans failed to hold Stuart Skidmore's shot and Alex COWLEY netted the rebound.</p>
  <p>However from this point on, Halesowen seemed to rest on their laurels for the remainder of the half and Bedworth were back on level terms when Matt COPPIN headed home Kristian Kelsall's long cross from the right. Coppin's 41st minute corner then provided the winner when a neat knock on by Scott Hadland sent James RICHARDSON into the area to blast home. Substitute forward Jimmy Haarhoff came on for the second half and proved an inspiration for Halesowen with his clever running and passing creating a string of chances. Nathan Lamey wasted the first chance, Jason Moore failed to reach the second and finally Simon Forsdick shot weakly at the goalkeeper. That was the pattern in the second half, with Town having most of the possession but never really looking like scoring. Bedworth themselves had chances to score through Joe Hanney and Lee Ross, but with an important FA Trophy game coming up on Saturday, they were just happy to hold on. On the other hand, Halesowen will feel it is a game they could have easily won with a better performance.</p>
