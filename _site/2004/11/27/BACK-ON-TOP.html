        <h1>BACK ON TOP</h1>
        <h2>Banbury 1 Yeltz 4</h2>
        <h3>27 November 2004</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz went back to the top of the table with an emphatic 4-1 victory at Banbury on Saturday. Goals from Preston, The Pope, a Burgess cracker and a fourth from Nick Amos (according to everyone who was there) took us above Merthyr who didn't play. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Next Saturday we travel once again, this time to  <a href="http://www.aylesburyunited.co.uk/">Aylesbury</a> . They've faded somewhat since their excellent start and are now down in mid-table, so let's hope we can keep our excellent form going and stay ahead of the chasing pack.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Banbury United: Tricker; Essex (McKay 51), Jackson (Stidder 82), Sullivan, Burnham, O'Neill, Stanbridge, Blossom, Fuller, Redknap, Potter (Pond 82).</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Burgess, Lamey (Baker 50), Amos, Forsdick (Skidmore 82). Unused Subs: Grocutt, Moore</p>
  <p>Referee: W. Ramsay (Coventry)  Attendance: 392</p>
  <p>Injury-hit Halesowen took full advantage of a game in hand to move back to the top of the table.</p>
  <p>The victory keeps up a sequence of 15 games in which the Puritans have failed to beat the Yeltz, spanning a period of 40 years since a 7-2 reversal way back in 1964-5.</p>
  <p>In a bright start, Simon Forsdick embarked on a weaving run in the 2nd minute before hitting over the bar from 20 yards and the visitors forced two 4th minute corners. Halesowen took the lead when Forsdick won a 6th minute corner and the Banbury defence allowed Dave Haywood's corner kick to drop for Niki PRESTON to steam in and convert at close range.</p>
  <p>George Redknap poked Liam O'Neill's free-kick just wide for the hosts on 11 minutes before the Yeltz raced into a two-goal lead. Alex Cowley's left-wing free-kick caught out Banbury's defence again and captain Steve POPE headed home unopposed. With the visitors well on top, both Pope and Nick Amos went close in a 17th minute goalmouth scramble from Haywood's corner.</p>
  <p>Yeltz goalkeeper Chris Taylor finally saw some action by collecting Andy Fuller's 21st minute shot from the edge of the area and Fuller then curled a 20 yard freekick against the outside of the post two minutes later. But Halesowen dominated the closing stages of the first half with Mark Essex clearing from Burgess from a quick Haywood break on 31 minutes and Nathan Lamey shielded the ball for Forsdick to force a fine save from goalkeeper Simon Tricker with a 20 yard drive two minutes later. Burgess then rattled the post on 34 minutes when he connected with a right-wing corner and Tricker saved the rebound from Lamey. After a series of 38th minute crosses caused further danger, Burgess struck high from a good position.</p>
  <p>Halesowen undid their good work and were pegged back to 2-1 against the run of play in the 41st minute when Fuller's deep freekick was turned into the path of Chris Potter and he beat Taylor from 10 yards.</p>
  <p>BURGESS eased any Halesowen worries by restoring the two goal advantage at the perfect time just two minutes into the second half by latching onto Lamey's pass and hitting a stunning 15-yard strike beyond Tricker. Cowley then cut in from the right but his 20-yard effort rebounded off Tricker's post on the hour and three minutes later Preston blazed over the bar in front of goal from Burgess's clever flick-on. Tricker then denied Preston on 65 minutes and Redknap cleared the resulting corner off the line. In one of their few second-half attacks, Banbury's Chris Jackson fired a 67th minute freekick just over the bar from 25 yards.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes from time AMOS added a fourth goal by rising above the home defence to head home another Haywood set piece.</p>
