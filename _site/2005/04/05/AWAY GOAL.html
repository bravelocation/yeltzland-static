        <h1>AWAY GOAL</h1>
        <h2>WSC Final 1L  Studley 1 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>05 April 2005</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz managed to draw 1-1 against the even mightier Studley in the first leg of the Worcester Senior Cup last night. They took the lead in the first half but we equalised through Nick Smith in the second to set up a surprisingly close second leg in a couple of weeks.</p>
  <p>The bad news of the night is The Pope was carried off with concussion after being caught by Taylor and spent the night in hospital. Not good news with some massive promotion games coming up.</p>
  <p>The first of those is at The Grove on Saturday when we host King's Lynn. They're only two points behind us with a game in hand so it's crucial we beat them if we can. It's going to be exciting to say the least!</p>

  <p>The first leg of the Worcestershire Senior Cup final finished all-square at the Beehive.</p>
  <p>But the hard-working Studley strugglers from the Travel Factory Alliance had the better of the evening with striker Kevin Jones in particular catching the eye against lack-lustre Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Goalkeeper Chris Taylor bludgeoned out of goal with fists flying in the 8th minute but only managed to knock his own player Steve Pope unconscious. The Halesowen captain was therefore forced to leave the field early for the second successive game, this time on a stretcher to be detained overnight in hospital with concussion.</p>
  <p>Taylor was then penalised for pushing from a 25th minute right wing corner and Anthony SAVERY despatched the resulting penalty to give Studley the lead in their first season in the Worcestershire Senior Cup.  The lively Jones broke free on 39 minutes but looped his effort over the Halesowen bar in an otherwise unappetising first half.</p>
  <p>After the lethargic start from the visitors, Nicki Preston headed a deep Alex Cowley cross over the bar on 41 minutes and Simon Forsdick blasted high in Halesowen's first attempts of the evening after winning a couple of corners.</p>
  <p>But with the Bees buzzing, Savery nodded inches wide from a free-kick on the edge of the area with Taylor beaten in the final minute of the first half. Seconds later Savery then skipped down the right wing after producing a clever flick but Adam Blake headed high with Taylor troubled again.</p>
  <p>Nick SMITH rifled home Halesowen's equaliser on 54 minutes with a left foot shot from the edge of the area to beat home goalkeeper Craig Johnson from Cowley's right-wing cross. On the hour a tricky run from midfield by Jones gave Savery another Studley opening but Taylor beat away his 20-yard shot. Jones then burst free again five minutes later but Taylor blocked with his legs and Preston cleared off the line as Scott Walsh followed up from the rebound.</p>
  <p>On the hour a tricky run from midfield by Jones gave Savery another Studley opening but Taylor beat away his 20-yard shot. Jones then burst free again five minutes later but Taylor blocked with his legs and Preston cleared off the line as Scott Walsh followed up from the rebound.</p>
  <p>Forsdick's left wing shot fell inches wide in the 71st minute but the game drifted towards a draw following a series of substitutes to set up an evenly poised second leg at the Grove on April 19th.</p>
  <p>In the final minute Studley goalkeeper Johnson was penalised for handling marginally outside of his area but then did just enough to keep out Cowley's resulting free-kick.</p>
  <p>With Ian Cooper suspended for the next three games and Pope doubtful following his injury, Halesowen look like entering the vital league game with Kings Lynn with a further depleted squad.</p>
