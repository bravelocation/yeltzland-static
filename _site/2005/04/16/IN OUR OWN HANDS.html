        <h1>IN OUR OWN HANDS</h1>
        <h2>Grantham 0 Yeltz 2</h2>
        <h3>16 April 2005</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz gained a crucial three points with a vital 2-0 victory at Grantham, and with some other results going our way we can now guarantee a play-off spots by winning our last two games.</p>
  <p>It appears it was a pretty convincing victory on Saturday, and it's excellent to see Jason scoring once again. So it's on to Hitchin next week (definitely rearranged) in a very important last away game - or hopefully not! Not sure there are many plans for fancy dress this year, but it's going to be an excellent day out.</p>
  <p>Before that we have the distraction of the Worcester Senior Cup Final on Tuesday at The Grove against Studley. It's 1-1 from the first leg, and although it would be great to win something the most important thing is everyone remains fit for the remaining league games.</p>

  <p>Grantham Town: Duffy; Wooding, Weale, Sturgess, Julian, Steed, Evans, Francis, White, Matthews (Glover 45), Hallows (F. Smith 45). Unused Subs: Quailey, Sneddon, Fox.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Skidmore, Haywood (Baker), Preston, Pope, N. Smith, Cowley, Moore, Haarhoff, Amos, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Johnson, Lamey</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Jones (Biggleswade)         Attendance: 371</p>
  <p>Halesowen boosted their play-off hopes by moving into 4th spot in the league with a comfortable victory at the South Kesteven Stadium in Lincolnshire.</p>
  <p>Grantham's Tim Wooding blasted a shot wide on 13 minutes but it was the visitors who took a 2-0 first half lead after a good opening 45 minutes.</p>
  <p>The opening goal came on 21 minutes when Jimmy Haarhoff worked down the right and sent in a low cross for Jason MOORE to convert his first league goal for five months. Two minutes later Dave Haywood was allowed to advance but shot just wide.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz added a second goal on 30 minutes following a mistake by the home goalkeeper. Ayden Duffy beat a Nick Smith shot away and from Haywood's corner Duffy could only parry away Haarhoff's weak shot and leading marksman Steve POPE was on hand to turn the ball home.</p>
  <p>Grantham seemed to have found a way back into the game on 53 minutes when Stuart Skidmore was penalised for handling the ball in the area from a throw-in. However, Halesowen escaped when Jason White could only watch his penalty kick being tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Chris Taylor.</p>
  <p>On the hour Simon Forsdick's headed just wide from another Haywood corner as Halesowen remained good value for their vital three points.</p>
