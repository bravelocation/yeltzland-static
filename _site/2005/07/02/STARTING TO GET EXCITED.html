  <p>It's July, which means thoughts finally start turning to the pre-season friendlies and the new season. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>There's been some activity within the the squad so far - mainly up front where Jason and Jimmy have left us with Howard Forinton and Gary Hay joining us to form what will hopefully be a more productive front-line (with Nathan) than last season. It's a shame in particular to see Jason go, but he was well below his previous form last year so it makes sense (to me anyway!)</p>
  <p>Friendlies start on July 13th at The Grove when Walsall are the visitors, and we have a pretty decent set of  <a href="/anorak/results.asp?season=2005">matches</a>  arranged.</p>
  <p>The draws for the FA Cup and the Trophy have also been made, and miracle of miracles we've got home draws! FA Cup 1QR gives us South Normanton Athletic or Arnold Town, and in the Trophy we've got Willenhall.</p>
  <p>I'm very much looking forward to the new season, where I hope we can build on the progress we made last year and challenge strongly for promotion. I'm also hoping that there'll be a lot less moaning this year and people will appreciate a bit more what a great club we are, but I'm not holding my breath :-(</p>
