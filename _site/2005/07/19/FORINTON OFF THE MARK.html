        <h1>FORINTON OFF THE MARK</h1>
        <h2>Friendly  Yeltz 4 WBA 3</h2>
        <h3>19 July 2005</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz turned in another four goal performance in beating a reserve Albion side 4-3 last night at The Grove. Coming from behind three times, and Howard Forinton scoring what sounds like an impressive hat-trick, all in all it's another promising pre-season performance.</p>
  <p>Next game is on Saturday, again at The Grove, when Nuneaton are the visitors.</p>

  <p>West Bromwich Albion XI: Daniels; Hodgkiss, A. Triallist, Forsyth, Darg, Davies, Smikle, Pringle, Elvins, Nicholson, Humphrey. Subs: Kelleher, Downing, McGovern, McDonald, McQuilkin</p>

  <p>Halesowen came from behind three times to run out narrow winners in a seven-goal thriller against a lively youth and reserve squad representing the Baggies</p>
  <p>Albion took the lead after just 28 seconds when last season's leading reserve team goal-scorer Rob ELVINS met a cross from Jared Hodgkiss and his header looped into the net.</p>
  <p>Howard Forinton hit a 20-yard drive just wide in the 5th minute but FORINTON then equalised in the 14th minute by unleashing a tremendous 20-yard finish after strike partner Nathan Lamey headed on.</p>
  <p>Chris Taylor saved from Elvins in the 16th minute and three minutes later free-kick specialist Rob Davies curled a 20-yard dead-ball kick just around the post. In a 26th minute break, Forinton combined with Lamey again but struck straight at goalkeeper Luke Daniels. Taylor then saved a 32nd minute volley from Brian Smikle and instinctively kept out the follow-up from Davies.</p>
  <p>The West Brom youngsters regained the lead on 34 minutes when Stuart NICHOLSON slotted home at the second attempt after his first shot was well blocked by Taylor.</p>
  <p>FORINTON levelled for the second time for Halesowen on the stroke on half-time by staying on-side from a long ball and lobbing goalkeeper Daniels when clear on goal.</p>
  <p>At the start of the second period Lamey's shot was turned for a corner and Daniels collected Nicki Preston's header from Forinton's cross. Another Forinton strike was blocked on the hour before a good turn from Ben Pringle set up NICHOLSON to convert his second goal and put the visitors back in front after 61 minutes.</p>
  <p>But Halesowen finished with a flourish and Daniels was forced into a fine 64th minute save after Lamey was left in space following a defensive slip-up. LAMEY then punished more defensive hesitancy a couple of minutes later to slam home Halesowen's third equaliser from a narrow angle.</p>
  <p>Two minutes from time, FORINTON completed his hat-trick by turning Jeff Forsyth and drilling home the winner under Daniels from 12 yards.</p>
