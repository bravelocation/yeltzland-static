  <p>Things haven't started exactly how we imagined - when do they ever? - but the slightly rocky start to the season got a lot better after a good 1-0 victory away to King's Lynn.</p>
  <p>My holiday meant I couldn't update the site much last week, so there's a whole series of  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=20082005">Dave's match reports</a>  available for your pleasure.</p>
  <p>Our next game is on Tuesday at home to Banbury. They've had a pretty good start with two wins and a loss, but I'd hope we can build on Saturday's victory and keep in touch with the early leaders.</p>
