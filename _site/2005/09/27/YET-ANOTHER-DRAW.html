        <h1>YET ANOTHER DRAW</h1>
        <h2>Evesham 1 Yeltz 1</h2>
        <h3>27 September 2005</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>With our 5th draw in 9 games, the mighty Yeltz are not surprisingly stuck lounging in mid-table in what's been a pretty disappointing start to the league season. At least we didn't throw the lead away this time, with Howard getting his first league goal to equalise an earlier Richard Ball goal for Evesham.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we host Chesham at The Grove. They've also had an average start to the year and are also mid-table (although above us in the table), so lets hope we can get all three points to keep us in touch.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Darren</h3>

  <p>Evesham United: Adey, Watson, Hamilton, Robinson, A Cooper, O'Toole, Blake, Hadland, Ball, Clarke (Hall 82), Martin (Pinkney 82). Unused subs: Bailey, Hands, Knurek</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman, Johnson, Haywood, Preston, Pope (c), I Cooper (Strachan 72), Cowley, Lamey, Forinton, N Smith, Forsdick. Unused subs: C Smith, Pierpoint, Skidmore, Jay</p>
  <p>Booked: Ball 62 Attendance: 200</p>
  <p>A disappointing draw was all both sides deserved in a poor game, although Evesham will have been more disappointed to have not got the three points after having the majority of the second half</p>
  <p>A scrappy start from both sides was a sign of things to come. Neither team could gain any control, although it was Halesowen who created the first couple of chances through a 6th minute Dave Hayward free kick which was taken well by Adey and then a 12th minute through ball from Cowley to Forsdick was cleared by the solid looking Evesham defence. Lamey then struck a free kick against the wall a minute later.</p>
  <p>Following a delay of a couple of minutes after Steve Pope was hit in the face by the ball on 16 minutes, Howard Forinton ran through but hit a weak shot at the keeper.</p>
  <p>A Lamey free kick swung in from the right was headed over by Forsdick on 29 minutes, and Forinton turned his defender on 35 minutes but shot just wide.&#xD;
From the goal kick the ball was allowed over Nick Preston's head and RICHARD BALL ran on to score past Coleman.</p>
  <p>On the stroke of half time, a Forsdick shot was defended for a corner. From this, Nick Smith headed into the ground but too powerfully and the ball went over.</p>
  <p>Straight from the kick off in the second half, a good move between Forinton and Lamey resulted in Smith being put clear, but his shot went straight at the keeper.</p>
  <p>Strong protests for a handball on 54 minutes by Karl Johnson were waved away by the referee as Ball hit wide.</p>
  <p>On 61 minutes Lamey managed to spring the offside trap but hit over from outside the area. Another long ball on 68 minutes fell to Forsdick, but the keeper cleared for a throw in.</p>
  <p>On 73 minutes a clearance from Coleman found HOWARD FORINTON who lobbed the keeper to score his first league goal for Halesowen. Three minutes later, Forsdick hit over after good work on the edge of the box.</p>
  <p>Evesham had a free kick by O'Toole on 81 minutes which was punched clear.&#xD;
With a minute to go Forinton hit the side netting after being put clear by a Pope clearance, but Halesowen were left with a fifth draw in a game they should have been expected to win.</p>
