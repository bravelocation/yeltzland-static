  <p>The mighty Yeltz were knocked out of the FA Cup on Saturday by local rivals Bromsgrove, losing 2-0 at a very wet Grove.</p>
  <p>To be honest they were a decent team, playing some good football considering the conditions, but it was pretty even all the way through. The first goal was always going to be crucial, and once they'd scored in the second half on the rebound from a speculative long-shot it was going to be hard. The second killed us off, and we probably didn't deserve much more seeing as we never made Tim Clarke make a save. Ho Hum.</p>
  <p>It was my first time seeing us play this season (plenty of other jinx candidates though!) and it was a little disappointing. I was very impressed by H up front, but Fozzy was unrecognisable (not just because he's got no hair) and we didn't really pass it well at all. Completely unfair to judge on one day in the wet though, so I'll leave it at that.</p>
  <p>We're back to league action on Tuesday when Yate are the visitors. They've not had a great start, but won 4-1 against Cheshunt on Saturday so, like most games in this league, it isn't going to be easy.</p>
