        <h1>A DECENT POINT</h1>
        <h2>Bath City 0 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>22 October 2005</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz gained a valuable point with a 0-0 draw away at Bath. With lots of injuries this is a pretty creditable performance as it's never an easy place to go.</p>
  <p>Surprisingly enough there appears to be some difference of opinion on whether we were terrible and just went to stifle the game, or whether we played quite well - it's no surprise which side has which opinion - but obviously we're right as we're proven experts on football as well as generally neutral on these things.</p>
  <p>We're next in action on Tuesday when Grantham visit The Grove. They're 7th (not 3rd!) in  the table , but we've already got a draw at their place so let's hope for a win to keep up right in touch.</p>

  <p>Due to injuries Halesowen fielded a much changed side from the previous few matches. However it didn't appear to disrupt them too much as they battled hard to earn a good point and frustrate Bath City at Twerton Park.</p>
  <p>Nick Smith earned the Yeltz an early free kick and new loan signing Harkness was unlucky with his first contribution on 3 minutes when he struck a free kick over the wall but Paul Evans in the Bath goal tipped over.</p>
  <p>Bath responded well and a throw in on 5 minutes was headed just wide by Walsh on 5 minutes. On 9 minutes a Harkness through ball allowed Nathan Lamey to break free down the left and he pulled back a cross to Chris Smith who hit wide after the defender missed the ball completely.</p>
  <p>Another Walsh header following a diagonal cross was just over on 23 minutes. Halesowen won a corner on 26 minutes, which Nick Smith picked up the short corner and crossed, but Bath cleared well</p>
  <p>Pressure from Bath resulted in a free kick being conceded on 35 minutes by captain Pope, but Sandell's free kick on the left was well gathered by Coleman. Another free kick on 39 minutes resulted in a similar catch by Coleman stopping the Bath pressure.</p>
  <p>On the stroke of half time an effort by Nick Smith was well wide after he was put through by Amos.</p>
  <p>The second half began with a slight delay on 47 minutes after Harris fell awkwardly for the home side. Lamey won a free kick just after the delay but was cleared well.</p>
  <p>Harkness swung another excellent left footed cross on 54 minutes but Evans caught well under pressure. Three minutes later and Harkness blasted over from outside the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were awarded a free kick on 58 minutes in their own area much to the Bath City fan's annoyance, when a Coleman clearance hit the arm of the advancing City player.</p>
  <p>A Lamey header went close on 59 minutes after Harkness put over another good cross.</p>
  <p>Coleman saved well on 61 minutes, but the ball fell to Partridge who hit the ball against the post with the goal open. The play was broke up in the final 20 minutes with several substitutions by both sides as Bath tried to get the home win and Halesowen held strong for the point.</p>
  <p>A Pope handball gave away a free kick on the right on 70 minutes which resulted in a shot being well tipped round the post by a diving Coleman. &#xD;
Holloway narrowly headed wide on 85 minutes but Bath couldn't find a way through, and on 88 minutes Halesowen nearly snatched all three points when Forsdick laid back to Nick Smith who hit a strong shot but Evans was well placed to save.</p>
