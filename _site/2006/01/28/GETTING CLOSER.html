        <h1>GETTING CLOSER</h1>
        <h2>Yeltz 2 Evesham 0</h2>
        <h3>28 January 2006</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz moved up a remarkable  6 places in the table  with a solid 2-0 win at home to Evesham. Goals from Nathan and Howard moved us up into 7th place - which I think is our highest position so far this season - with games in hand on several of the teams above us.</p>
  <p>We begin a crucial run of 4 away games out of 5 on Monday with a trip down to play Team Bath. They've only won 2 out of their last 8 games, but one of those was away at league leaders Salisbury on Saturday so it's not going to be easy. However I'll be at the game bringing my usual good luck along, and hopefully I won't end up kicking the dustbin like my last trip to Twerton Park. :-)</p>

  <p>Halesowen boosted their play-off hopes with a professional performance to record their fifth win in seven games.</p>
  <p>Stuart Skidmore received a trophy before the kick-off to mark recently reaching 150 appearances in over ten years of service to Halesowen Town.</p>
  <p>Worcestershire neighbours Evesham were unbeaten for four games and squandered an excellent chance in only the second minute when former Yeltz striker Richard Ball robbed Nicki Preston in front of goal but could only touch the ball against goalkeeper Dean Coleman. A minute later Simon Forsdick blasted at Evesham goalkeeper Dave Adey from the left. Coleman then did well to take out Ball's right-wing cross with John Williams advancing in the 7th minute.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz grabbed the lead in the 11th minute with a well-worked goal when Forsdick's left-wing cross was headed back across goal by Howard Forinton to give leading goal-scorer Nathan LAMEY a simple close range tap-in.</p>
  <p>On 23 minutes, Coleman produced an excellent finger-tip save to turn Rob Taylor's blistering 30-yard drive over the bar. But Halesowen response was immediate as Dave Haywood picked out Forinton seconds later only to see Adey save his drive from the right at the second attempt. After 26 minutes Scott Hadland's shot was then blocked in a good spell of home pressure.</p>
  <p>The game developed into a midfield battle for the rest of the half with the brash, bustling visitors sending long balls into the area without really creating many good openings. But the Robins started the second half on fire as they pushed Halesowen back. Ball was eventually crowded out after Steve Pope's challenge in the 49th minute after finding a gap at the heart of the Halesowen defence and a minute later Coleman collected Richard Robinson's drive. Williams then blazed over the bar in the 53rd minute.</p>
  <p>Halesowen came back to life in the 63rd minute when Forsdick's snap shot from the edge of the area was saved low-down by Adey. Victory was then sealed in the 65th minute after excellent work from Forsdick saw him win possession and the ball was flicked on for FORINTON to produce a fine finish into the bottom corner from 12 yards to notch his 12th goal of the season.</p>
  <p>The second goal took the wind out of Evesham's sails as the Yeltz coasted home and they could've added a further goal in the 71st minute when Lamey's cross found Forinton in space but he hit his first-time shot wide from 18 yards.</p>
