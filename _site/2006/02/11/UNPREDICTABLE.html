    Just when we looked like we were getting a run together, we go and do this. In a very disappointing result, the indomitable Yeltz lost 3-1 at home to Team Bath on Saturday. From all accounts (see the match report on ), we didn't deserve anything more out of the game. Hmmm.

  <p>We have two crucial away games coming up this week - on Wednesday we travel to Tiverton before another trip down the M5 on Saturday to Yate. We must get at least one victory out of those two games to be in with a shout of promotion I think, but we can do it so let's not start moaning too early.</p>
  <p>(Apologies for the slow updating of the site - I'm in the USA on business again so I'm even more out of touch than usual)</p>
