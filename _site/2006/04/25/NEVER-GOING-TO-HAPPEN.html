        <h2>WSC Final 2L  Yeltz 1 Moor Green 1</h2>
        <h3>25 April 2006</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>I think I can safely say we lost it in the first leg. In front of 189 brave souls the mighty Yeltz drew 1-1 against Moor Green in the second leg of the WSC Final to lose 5-2 on aggregate. Oh well.</p>
  <p>So down to Chippenham on Saturday for the last game of the season. Let's hope for a rousing send off to get our hopes up for next season - and it would be very nice to beat our old rivals Chippenham! I'll be there so I hope to see many of you at the traditional last away game festivities.</p>

Sponsors' HTFC Man of the Match: Nick Amos</p>
  <p>Moor Green became worthy winners of the Worcestershire Senior Cup after never seeming in danger of losing their large first leg lead.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's depleted squad were left with a mountain to climb and young reserve team player Aaron Humphries made an unexpected debut after player of the season Simon Forsdick was delayed by traffic in their bid to retain the trophy.</p>
  <p>The hosts had little to offer in the opening half although Ian Cooper hit a speculative shot well over the bar in the 16th minute and Martin Myers struck wide of the post seven minutes later.</p>
  <p>A fourth minute back-header from Chris Nurse flashed wide for Moor Green from David Bridgwater's corner and on 29 minutes Gary McPhee blasted well wide down the left. Seconds before the interval Darren Middleton then struck high over bar.</p>
  <p>Moor Green took the lead in the 56th minute when Philip Midworth's left wing cross was headed home powerfully from close range by NURSE. A 30-yard free-kick from David Bridgwater then bounced just over the Halesowen bar in the 65th minute and Chris Smith struck the Moor Green side-netting on 72 minutes.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz levelled the score on the night in the 73rd minute when Dave Haywood's free-kick from inside his own half was headed on by Myers for Nick SMITH to bundle past Ashley Timms from the right. A minute from full-time Forsdick's snapshot was beaten away by Timms but it was Moor Green who stepped up to receive the Senior Cup Trophy from the Worcestershire FA in front of the Harry Rudge stand.</p>
