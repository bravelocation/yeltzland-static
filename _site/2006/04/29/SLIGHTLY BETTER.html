        <h1>SLIGHTLY BETTER</h1>
        <h2>Chippenham 0 Yeltz 0</h2>
        <h3>29 April 2006</h3>
        
        <p>
  <p>It's finally all over. Having nothing to play for at the end of the season has been a strange experience - we've been challenging for promotion or relegartion for the last few years - and has been very dull.</p>
  <p>
    We finished the season with a decent 0-0 draw at Chips and Ham. I think we had the better of a pretty non-descript game, with their keeper making a few decent saves. Thanks as usual to Dave for his excellent  - and well done for winning Fantasy Island!
    
  </p>
  <p>Have a jolly summer - let's hope for a decent World Cup to get us through the long sunny evenings - and on to the excitement of a new season!</p>

  <p>Halesowen signed off their mixed season with creditable draw at play-off placed Chippenham.</p>
  <p>Remarkably, the result meant that Halesowen did not concede a single goal away at any of the top five promotion candidates and no side completed the double over the Yeltz during the season.</p>
  <p>But a lack of goals and too many draws proved to be Halesowen's downfall throughout the season and this was displayed again at Hardenhuish Park where the visitors failed to capitalise on their superiority</p>
  <p>Both goalkeepers were on top form and made splendid saves to keep the first half goal-less. The hosts went close in the 7th minute when Ben Kirk headed back a Nick Stanley corner for Gary Thorne to scoop over the bar from just ten yards. Steve Winter's 14th minute free-kick drifted past the post and Stanley volleyed over the bar two minutes later.</p>
  <p>Player of the season Simon Forsdick then went in search of goals and his 20th minute shot was deflected just wide. A minute later Stuart Pierpoint found Forsdick and he composed himself before unleashing a goal-bound 20-yard shot but goalkeeper Steve Perrin made a splendid save to tip the ball away for a corner. Matt Rawlins flashed a 25th minute header wide of Halesowen's post and ten minutes later Forsdick shot over the bar again.</p>
  <p>A minute before the interval Dean Coleman made a superb fingertip save to claw away substitute Matthew McEntegart's header following Winter's free-kick.</p>
  <p>Halesowen went on to control the second period but found goalkeeper Perrin in excellent form. On 50 minutes James Francis broke down the left but his five yard shot was blocked by Perrin. Nick Amos headed on for Nick Smith in the 56th minute but Perrin collected his deflected shot and after 65 minutes Perrin punched away Amos' header from Nick Smith's corner.</p>
  <p>Perrin produced another tremendous breathtaking save to deny Howard Forinton's 66th minute header from a Dave Haywood corner.</p>
  <p>The stalemate meant the Bluebirds faced the long Bank Holiday Monday trip to face King's Lynn in the play-off semi-final.</p>
