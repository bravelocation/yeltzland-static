    <h3>Friendly  Yeltz 1 B'ham City 2</h3>

    Another reasonable performance in a pre-season friendly, this time a 2-1 loss against a Birmingham City XI managed by ex-yeltz boss Stewart Hall. As usual, full details in .

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Harris; Colwell, Charlton, Kavanagh (Trainer 55), Smith (J. &#xD;

Hallam (Ashby HT), Blake (Spencer 55), March. Sub: Gayle</p>

O'Brian, Birley, Parratt</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Mariner</p>
  <p>Ex-Halesowen manager Stewart Hall brought his pacy youngsters to the Grove &#xD;
but it was Halesowen's Leon Mitchell who hit inches wide in the 4th minute &#xD;
after turning defender Lee Vaughan with a clever back-heel. Mark Hallam's &#xD;
header then produced a reflex save from James Dormond in the 10th minute.</p>
  <p>City went ahead after 21 minutes through Andy Borrowman who slotted into an &#xD;
empty net when young goalkeeper Matt Harris raced off his line but &#xD;
completely missed his attempted headed clearance of a long ball. With the &#xD;
visitors on top, Craig Fagan struck the side-netting from a good position on &#xD;
the half-hour before Peter Till lashed home a second goal in the 44th minute &#xD;
as Halesowen's defence failed to clear a corner.</p>
  <p>Borrowman then hit the underside of the Halesowen bar from 5 yards straight &#xD;
after the break and Richard Colwell made a timely clearance from Fagan in &#xD;
the 73rd minute.</p>
  <p>Jason Ashby pulled a goal back with a simple tap-in after 76 minutes when &#xD;
goalkeeper Dormond dropped a Jamie March cross and four minutes later Andy &#xD;
Spencer cracked just wide as Halesowen finished more strongly.</p>

    <h3>Friendly  Yeltz 1 Alfreton 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    Here we go again. I think I say this every year, but this is . After last year's relegation I think it may have worked for the best, now we know if we win the league we can get into one of the new Conference Division Ones. It's not going to be as easy as two years ago, but we've definitely got lots to play for.

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town (First Half): Gayle; Colwell, Small, Baker, Sewell, Grocutt, Hollis, Spencer, Hallam, Ashby, March</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town (Second Half): Harris; Clarke, Charlton, Smith, J. Skidmore, Blake, Wray, Kavanagh, Mitchell, Phillips, Trainer</p>
  <p>Alfreton Town: Butler; Circuit, Grayston, Cotterill, Brown, Knapper, Dolby, Robinson, Askey, Nawadike, Hemmings</p>
  <p>Referee: T. Parkes (Birmingham)</p>
  <p>Halesowen opened their pre-season with a pleasing draw against newly promoted Unibond Premier big spenders Alfreton Town in a re-match of January's FA Trophy clash.</p>
  <p>The hosts had the slightly better first half with ex-Tamworth striker Mark Hallam heading just wide from fellow new-boy Lewis Baker in the 4th &#xD;
minute. Jason Ashby then linked-up with Hallam in the 21st minute before &#xD;
hitting his effort wide. Other new summer signings Darren Grocutt, Simon &#xD;
Hollis and Jamie March also caught the eye in the first period with a 38th &#xD;
minute cross from March headed across goal by Hollis.</p>
  <p>Halesowen ran the rule over a number of possibles by naming a completely &#xD;
different line-up for the second half and they took a 54th minute lead when &#xD;
manager's son Kelvin Phillips split the Alfreton defence allowing ex-Sutton &#xD;
Coldfield striker Leon Mitchell to convert from 12 yards. Young home &#xD;
goalkeeper Matt Harris saved acrobatically from the unmarked Ian Robinson &#xD;
just after the hour before the visitors equalised through the experienced &#xD;
Tony Hemmings from the penalty spot in the 63rd minute after a handball just &#xD;
inside the Halesowen area.</p>
  <p>Alfreton goalkeeper Lee Butler denied Phillips twice in the 75th minute and on-trial central defender Josh Skidmore kept Alfreton's strong forward &#xD;
line at bay at the opposite end, although Ian Robinson hit a 20-yard drive &#xD;
inches wide of the mark in the 87th minute.</p>

    <h3></h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's been pretty quiet so far - it is only June after all - but there's been quite a few players let go from the squad that got us relegated last year.</p>
  <p>I believe the following players not been resigned: Lee Collins, Les Hines, Gavin Stone, Richard Leadbeater,Tim Clarke, Neil Gibson, Gary Bauress, Mark Danks, Michael Blackwood, Lee Williams, Kirk Master.</p>
  <p>
    Signed so far: , a forward from Tamworth and  back from Redditch with a lot more to come (otherwise we've only got about 9 players). More news on  as people find out about it.
    
  </p>
  <p>According to Chas, the pre-season friendlies announced so far are Alfreton h July 19, Hednesford h Aug 5th, Willenhall a Aug 9th plus Bradford City, Blues, Oldbury no dates asy yet. Again, more when things have been confirmed.</p>
  <p>On the pyramid reorganisation, it will all be ratified on June 20th, but it looks at the moment like the top 7 of the Western Divison will help make up the new Southern Premier the season after, which you would really hope we can do. Could be a bit of a dull season ahead though.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 Chippenham 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The table never lies. Despite coming back from behind to beat Chippenham 3-2 we were always up against it, and congratulations to Grantham for beating Moor Green making them safe and putting us back in the Western Division again.</p>
  <p>
    We went one down early on, came back through a Stone scramble, went behind again, but came back brilliantly through a Big Rich scorcher and a Les penalty. However with regular reports coming through from Grantham we knew it was all over, on  from Cambridge in the end.
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Hateley; Colwell, Hines, Smith (Leadbeater 61), Collins, Stone, Williams, Ashby, Danks, Gibson (Spencer 52), Skidmore. Unused Subs: Trainer, Master, Garvey</p>
  <p>Chippenham Town: Bittner; Charity, Thorne, Towler, Davies, Badman, Harrington (Kear 89), Horgan, Mings (Walker 64), Paul, Griffin. Unused Subs: Andrews, Elsey, Bull</p>
  <p>Referee: R. Shoebridge (Belper)     Booked: Horgan (86)    Attendance: 730</p>
  <p>There was no minor miracle or great escape at the Grove despite Halesowen mounting a fine comeback to defeat Chippenham for the third time this season.</p>
  <p>The two promoted teams from 2002/2002 experienced vastly differing fortunes over the season and Halesowen's win was not enough to prevent last season's champions suffering their 2nd relegation in three years back to the Western Division. With Grantham thumping four goals past Moor Green the Yeltz were unable to catch any of their rivals and drop out of the league with one of the highest totals in history.</p>
  <p>Chippenham started strongly against their nervous hosts with Martin Paul striking wide in the 5th minute and Gary Horgan turning to hit a half-volley past the post on 14 minutes. Halesowen skipper Lee Collins was then on hand in the 22nd minute to clear up defensive confusion.</p>
  <p>The game sparked to life in the 24th minute when Mark Badman picked up the ball and threw it into the face of Neil Gibson who had committed a foul. A mass brawl followed but remarkably the referee only spoke to Stuart Skidmore and Gary Horgan and let off the culprits without any kind of warning. The break in play caught out Halesowen and Adie Mings headed Chippenham ahead with a simple 10-yard header directly from Charlie Griffin's resulting 26th minute free-kick.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's first real attempt on target came in the 28th minute when goalkeeper James Bittner parried away a shot from Jason Ashby and a minute later Gavin Stone powered in a header from a Lee Williams corner. Home goalkeeper Gary Hateley spilled a 33rd minute shot by Simon Charity from 20-yards but Collins tidied up again with Chippenham continuing to chase hard for third place in the league.</p>
  <p>Halesowen levelled in the 39th minute when a corner from Lee Williams was headed across goal by Collins for Gavin Stone to head home from close range despite Charity trying to clear off the line. Just before the break Les Hines saw a curling free-kick collected by Bittner and the Chippenham defence cleared an Ashby header from a Les Hines free-kick.</p>
  <p>The home side played with more urgency in the second period and Chippenham appeared to take their foot off the pedal. Mark Danks blasted high in the 51st minute and three minutes later a Williams free-kick came back out for Skidmore to drive over the bar from 25-yards out. Another Skidmore shot was deflected for Bittner to collect in the 59th minute and Danks curled past the post on the hour. Bittner then rescued Chippenham in the 62nd minute by clawing a header from substitute Andy Spencer around the post after Stone put in a cross from another Hines free-kick. With the hosts looking lively, home player-of-the-season Richard Colwell surged from midfield but Bittner dived down low to save well from Danks in the 69th minute.</p>
  <p>Chippenham regained the lead in the 70th minute when a through ball found Griffin free on the right and Paul followed up to head home on the goal-line after Hateley partly saved Griffin's shot. Griffin found himself free again three minutes later when Stone lost the ball but he blasted wide from 10 yards out.</p>
  <p>The plucky Yeltz produced a rousing finish with two goals in the last ten minutes defeating Chippenham. Substitute Richard Leadbeater chased a long ball in the 80th minute and when the ball broke kindly he lashed into the roof of the net to equalise a second time. A shot from Williams was then blocked by Walker in the 85th minute but Halesowen's brave fight-back was completed with the winning goal arriving four minutes from time when Griffin was penalised for pushing Danks in the penalty area. Hines stepped up to hit home the penalty to Bittner's left but Halesowen were soon to learn that their win was to no avail as they still finished in the fourth relegation spot on goal difference from Cambridge City.</p>

    <h3>DMC Final 2L  Crawley 2 Yeltz 0 (3-2 Agg.)</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We gave it a good go, but in the end it was probably fair enough we lost the League Cup Final by losing 2-0 to Crawley in the second leg.</p>
  <p>Once they'd scored early on we were behind on away goals and struggling, but when two down in the second half we almost took it to extra-time when Danks hit the bar, and a fantastic scramble led to Kirk blazing over. Still it's probably a good job we saved some energy for Saturday's massive game.</p>
  <p>Just to remind you: we'll stay up if we beat Chippenham at The Grove and Grantham lose at home to Moor Green, or if they draw we need to win by three goals.</p>
  <p>Bring all your mates, everyone you know and let's get right behind the lads for 90 minutes to do our part of the equation. Can't do anything about the other game but let's hope Moor Green come up trumps. Come On! Come On!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Crawley Town: Little; Holmes, Payne, Hooper, Pullan, Le Bihan, Harkin, Cooksey, McDonnell (Hockton 74), Bagnall, Brake. Unused Subs: Matten, Vines, Hemsley, Timlin</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Hateley; Colwell, Hines, Stone, Collins, Trainer, Williams (Master 68), Ashby (Leadbeater 62), Danks, Blackwood (Skidmore HT), Spencer. Unused Subs: Smith, Clarke</p>
  <p>Referee: R. Vaughan (Bristol) Attendance: 1049 Booked: Brake(64), Stone(70)</p>
  <p>Halesowen's brave League Cup run finally ended at the Broadfield Stadium although they can have no real complaints about missing out on their second piece of silverware of the season by the odd goal of five on aggregate.</p>
  <p>With a slender one-goal advantage from the first leg Halesowen went close in the 9th minute when Gavin Stone headed a Les Hines cross off the ground onto the underside of the crossbar with the Crawley defence blocking Jason Ashby's volley from the rebound. The home side took the lead to level the aggregate score after just 12 minutes when Hines lost the ball allowing Warren Bagnall to cross and Mo Harkin to pull the ball back for Nigel BRAKE to crash the ball into the net from 6 yards.</p>
  <p>Mark Danks poked the ball at goalkeeper Andy Little from 5 yards in the 20th minute from a good move between Lee Williams and Andy Spencer but the home side then enjoyed their best spell of pressure with Halesowen weathering the storm until the half-time whistle. Nic McDonnell's 21st minute penalty appeal was turned down after he fell in the box under challenge from Richard Colwell and on 39 minutes McDonnell crossed from the left for Bagnall to head straight at Gary Hateley. With Halesowen's defence exposed Collins let in Harkin to cross from the left a minute later but the ball evaded the Crawley strike-force and fell into safety. Hateley then raced off his line in the 41st minute to clear from Neil Le Bihan but conceded a corner from which Le Bihan struck the top of the bar. A minute before half-time McDonnell hit a half-volley just over the Halesowen bar.</p>
  <p>Five minutes into the second period Brake burst from the centre of midfield and was eventually denied by Stone. Crawley hit the cup-winning goal after 54 minutes when a long free-kick was headed on for McDONNELL with plenty of space and time to bury the ball past Hateley from 8 yards. Ernie Cooksey hit a 58th minute volley wide from 30 yards and seven minutes later Stone headed a free clearance in the Halesowen defence at McDonnell but the striker screwed his good chance wide.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen looking jaded Hateley raced off his line to clear from substitute Danny Hockton on 76 minutes but a minute later Halesowen's best chance of the half fell to Danks who latched onto the long clearance from Hateley but his shot struck the Crawley bar. On 90 minutes substitute Kirk Master was put through on the right but blasted high. The 4th official found 5 minutes of added time in which Little collected a Collins header from Stone's long throw and at the death McDonnell skied the ball high over the bar on the break from a good position at the other end.</p>

    <h3>Folkestone 2 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Well it's all going down to the last game, but it's not looking great. Failure to beat Folkestone means we're very close to being relegated for the second time in three seasons.</p>
  <p>
    It was a very disappointing game - see  - but that's gone now so let's concentrate on one last effort next week. It's pretty clear now what has to happen: we'll stay up if we win at Grantham lose at home to Moor Green, or if they draw we need to win by three goals. Not impossible, but obviously it's out of our hands now.
    
  </p>
  <p>Before that, we take a 2-1 lead to Crawley in the League Cup Final Second Leg. It's a real shame that we can't concentrate on this a bit more, but frankly it's a distraction before Saturday's showdown.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Folkestone Invicta: Munden; Everitt, Larkin, Lindsey, Henry, Guest (Towse 21), Chandler, Chambers, Ayling (Maxwell 90), Blackman, Millar. Unused Sub: Morris</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell (Gibson 80), Hines, Stone, Collins, Burnham (Spencer HT), Williams, Ashby, Leadbeater (Danks HT), Blackwood, Smith. Unused Subs: Trainer, Hateley</p>
  <p>Referee: M. O'Keefe (Orpington) Attendance: 351</p>
  <p>Halesowen's survival hopes were left hanging on a mathematical thread after only managing a draw against already relegated and rock-bottom Folkestone.</p>
  <p>The game itself mirrored Halesowen's season - a slow start, some improvement, another slump in the middle followed by a strong finish that was not quite enough to undo the earlier damage.</p>
  <p>In a cagey opening Richard Leadbeater headed on a long Jason Burnham throw in the 10th minute but Michael Blackwood volleyed straight at veteran goalkeeper Maurice Munden. Lee Blackman ran down the left for Folkestone in the 13th minute but Tim Clarke cleared for a corner and on 22 minutes Lee Williams volleyed over the bar from the edge of the box for Town. A minute later John Ayling raced into the area but Clarke made a fingertip save to earn the hosts a corner. Halesowen immediately broke up the field and Williams threaded the ball for Les Hines to strike the legs of Munden. Hines then hit a 25th minute free-kick from 18 yards straight at Munden.</p>
  <p>Folkestone took the lead from the penalty spot on 27 minutes with Martin CHANDLER blasting past Clarke after Gavin Stone was harshly penalised for pushing Blackman. Halesowen were awarded a penalty of their own just six minutes later when Blackwood burst into the area and was tugged back by Michael Everitt. Munden saved Les HINES' spot-kick by diving to his left but the ball rebounded for the full-back to follow-up and equalise.</p>
  <p>However, the goal failed to lift the Yeltz and they fell behind again in the 38th minute through sloppy defending with Chambers and Ayling exchanging a series of passes to set up James MILLAR to clip past Clarke from 6 yards. Two minutes before the break Clarke collected another chip from Millar after Ayling played the ball into Blackman.</p>
  <p>Halesowen made two half-time substitutions and stepped up a gear in the second half, looking hungry for a win. Clarke raced off his line to clear from Folkestone's Ayling after Halesowen won an early free-kick and corner. Dan Larkin then turned a Hines cross for a 51st minute corner with the ball bouncing off Danks and falling just over the bar. Munden then fumbled an overhead kick from Blackwood in the 52nd minute with Ashby chipping the resulting corner just high.</p>
  <p>ASHBY levelled for the second time for Halesowen in the 54th minute when he latched onto a long ball from Williams that was missed by Anthony Henry to slide the ball past Munden and slot into the net.</p>
  <p>That set up a final half-hour of pressure with Folkestone's backs to the wall as Halesowen poured forward in search of a vital win. Williams hit a 65th minute free-kick over the bar and Munden saved a down-header from Stone in the 70th minute. A minute later Munden saved a Lee Collins header from a corner kick but Chambers broke down the other end to set up Millar to strike inches wide of Clarke's post in the 78th minute.</p>
  <p>In an increasingly frantic finish Ashby cut in to hit wide on 80 minutes and Blackwood forced an 85th minute corner after Andy Spencer won the ball in his own box and played a long ball forward. Larkin headed a Collins header off the line on 86 minutes and in injury time Halesowen's final flourish saw them win three consecutive corners with two headed efforts from Collins and Stone cleared off the Folkestone goal-line.</p>
  <p>With the Yeltz failing to find the elusive winning goal and Hinckley winning at Tivvy, Halesowen must beat Chippenham and hope that Grantham slip up at home to Moor Green on the final Saturday in order to preserve their Premier division status.</p>

    <h3>WSC Final 2L  Evesham 0 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's been a difficult season but our excellent cup form hasn't gone unrewarded with a 3-0 aggregate win over Evesham in the Worcestershire Senior Cup. A goal from Mark Danks clinched an easy victory in the two legs over the Midland Division side.</p>
  <p>
    Saturday brings the most important game of the season so far down at Folkestone in a game we really must win. I'll repeat the strugglers' fixtures for reference below...
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Evesham United: Hart; A. Smith, Sage (Pinkney 58), Khela, Powell, Jukes, Wolsey, Oakey, Joyce, Bowen (Blake 75), Heath (Lennon 68). Unused Subs: Barnett, Ladek</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Hateley; Spencer, Hines, Stone, Collins (N. Smith 70), Burnham, Gibson, Danks (Clarke 83), Leadbeater (Ashby 63), Blackwood, Trainer. Unused Subs: Williams, Colwell</p>
  <p>Halesowen lifted the Worcestershire Senior Cup for the first time since 1962 with a comfortable three-goal aggregate victory.</p>
  <p>Evesham forced two early corners in the third minute before Halesowen went on to create a host of chances. In the 10th minute Michael Blackwood burst down the centre and blasted just high from 10 yards. Three minutes later Phil Trainer won the ball in midfield and was just beaten to the ball by goalkeeper Tim Hart rushing out of his goal. On 16 minutes Richard Leadbeater rose to head a Les Hines corner just over the bar and four minutes later an Andy Spencer shot was deflected just wide. On 23 minutes Blackwood broke down the right again and crossed for Mark Danks to lob a good chance over the bar.</p>
  <p>The returning Jason Burnham lost the ball in the 28th minute but Paul Oakey drove high from 25 yards out and on 32 minutes at the other end Danks scuffed another shot at Evesham keeper Hart from Trainer's right-wing cross.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz scored the only goal of the night on 48 minutes when the creative Blackwood cut in from the right to strike the right-hand post and DANKS followed up with a diving header into the net. Sam Bowen and Wesley Joyce hit tame close range efforts at Gary Hateley and Joyce then watched the ball trickle just wide when Hateley dropped a deep right wing cross on the hour.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen remained well in control with Neil Gibson forcing a corner on the left and then shooting straight at Hart before a cracking Hines volley hit the roof of the net. Hateley spectacularly clawed away a free-kick on the edge of the box from Nathan Jukes after 67 minutes and a minute later opposite goalkeeper Hart saved well from Danks following Jason Ashby's left-wing cross.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz gave themselves the luxury of using substitute goalkeeper Tim Clarke as a centre-forward for the last ten minutes and could have hit further goals when Andy Spencer from 20 yards in the 88th minute and Blackwood hit over the bar when clear on goal a minute later.</p>

    <h3>Newport 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    We're still fighting for our Premier Division lives with a battling 1-1 draw at Newport. A late goal from Jason means we're still in , and with Grantham beating Hinckley it's the latter who are the team to catch now.
    
  </p>
  <p>Obviously 3 points against Folkestone on Saturday are more or less essential, but it's all very close and you would hope two wins would make us safe.</p>
  <p>Before then, it's the second leg of the Worcester Senior Final at Evesham on Wednesday, where hopefully our 2-0 lead will be enough to clinch the trophy.</p>

  <p>Newport County: Wesson; C. Collins, Benton, Clark, Perry (Dupres 21), Fowler, Rose, Dimond, Plant (Dickeson 79), Shephard (Davis 24), Davies. Unused Subs: Stevenson, Fox</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Hateley; Colwell, Hines, Bauress (Danks 58), L. Collins, Stone, Williams, Ashby, Leadbeater (Blackwood 79), Gibson (Trainer 73), Smith. Unused Subs: Spencer, Clarke</p>

  <p>Halesowen kept the relegation battle bubbling to the end of the season with a fully deserved point at Newport.</p>
  <p>There was a blow before the kick-off when goalkeeper Tim Clarke failed to show up on time after failing to do his geographical homework. Despite eventually arriving to take a place on the substitute's bench Clarke will have suffered the disciplinary consequences as well as the damage to his reputation.</p>
  <p>Playing conditions again proved difficult in a swirling wind on the hard surface and in the first minute Newport's Matt Rose hit a half-volley just wide. Neil Gibson won an eighth minute corner for Halesowen but Billy Clark headed behind for a second Halesowen corner kick.</p>
  <p>Reserve goalkeeper Gary Hateley made an all-round competent performance punching a 12th minute corner from Michael Fowler clear and then made a fine save low down from Steve Benton's 16th minute bobbling shot. However, Hateley could not prevent the unmarked Billy CLARK from simply heading home the resulting 19th minute corner from Kristian Dimond.</p>
  <p>Halesowen responded well and in the 21st minute Gibson was put through but Rose intervened in the box. Lee Williams then played a neat one-two but his cross was taken out by goalkeeper Gareth Wesson. Steve Benton hit a 28th minute dipping shot over Hateley's bar but the Yeltz continued to create chances playing against the wind. Substitute Josh Dupres blocked when Richard Leadbeater turned to shoot in the area on 34 minutes and five minutes later Leadbeater then shot straight at Wesson. Three minutes before half-time Gibson appealed for a penalty after going down in the box from Neil Smith's cross and on the stroke of half-time Richard Colwell broke down the right to cross for Williams to strike over the bar.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to assert themselves in the second period although Raith Plant burst through from the left for the Exiles on 48 minutes beating Gary Bauress before hitting wide. Wesson then beat away a 52nd minute corner from Williams and saved a quickly taken free-kick from the same player two minutes later. Williams made a crucial interception on Rose at the other end in a Newport breakaway on the hour as the game opened up with Halesowen going for goal. Jason Ashby latched onto a long Lee Collins ball on 61 minutes but lobbed just high from 25 yards and five minutes later Stone headed a Les Hines corner kick just high.&#xD;
Substitute Mark Danks shot at Wesson on 74 minutes and five minutes from full time Wesson made a fine save from Michael Blackwood's free kick from the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's hard work was justifiably rewarded two minutes from time when a long Stone throw-in found its way to Hines and although his shot was blocked the ball fell for ASHBY to prod home against a static home defence.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Grantham 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A crucial winner from Les gained all three points in a game we had to win to have any chance of staying up.</p>
  <p>It was a difficult day for playing football, with a very strong wind and a hard, dusty pitch making it difficult for both sides. The first half was pretty poor and pretty even, although both teams were battling hard. It was still 0-0 with half the second half gone, so Brendan changed to three up front and in the 71st minute we got a priceless winner when Williams crossed to the near post, Rich flicked it on and Les was at the far post to knock it in. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>
    It was an unbelievably tense finish to the game - we had at least two great chances to clinch it - but eventually it was over in the hardest game to watch I can remember. With Hednesford beating Hinckley and Folkestone beating Hastings we're still in  but only a point behind with three games left.
    
  </p>
  <p>So on to Newport on Easter Monday in a game we need to pick up something from. If we can show the fight we did against Grantham, we can take all three. Come On!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Hines, Bauress, Collins (Danks 65), Stone, Williams, Ashby, Leadbeater, Gibson (Spencer 65), Smith. Unused Subs: Trainer, Blackwood, Hateley</p>
  <p>Grantham Town: Ziccardi; Hall, George (Wilkins 75), McDaid (Last 81), Speed, Gowshall, Marshall, Bull, Ranshaw, Wenlock (Hallows 79), Wilson. Unused Subs: Bowater, Hawley</p>
  <p>Referee: L. Hodson (Nuneaton) Attendance: 501</p>
  <p>Halesowen gave themselves a great chance of avoiding the drop by narrowly winning the vital 6-pointer against the fifth from bottom Gingerbreads. Quality football was never high on the agenda with the blustery wind and the perilous league positions of both sides producing a predictably hard-fought scrap.</p>
  <p>Straight from the kick-off Grantham goalkeeper Mario Ziccardi raced out to head clear and seconds later Lee Collins robbed Lee Marshall in the Halesowen area. Les Hines then drove over the bar from 20-yards in the 3rd minute. Halesowen won three corners in quick succession without troubling Ziccardi while at the other end Gavin Stone headed a Gary Bull free-kick clear. Collins then headed over his own bar in the 18th minute for the first of four Grantham corner kicks from which Tim Clarke saved a 19th minute Brendan McDaid header. A good left wing cross from Neil Gibson was headed away for a Yeltz corner on 28 minutes which Ziccardi cleared against his own player but Jason Ashby could only chip the loose ball over the bar.</p>
  <p>The best chance of the first half fell in the 40th minute when Gibson escaped his marker at the far post to meet a Lee Williams cross but then screwed wide from 10-yards out. A minute later Rick Ranshaw missed a good opportunity for Grantham at the other end.</p>
  <p>Halesowen applied early pressure in the second-half and won a 46th minute corner when Ziccardi saved a 25-yard Neil Smith volley. Gavin Stone then forced another corner with Gibson side-stepping his marker to drive inches wide from 20-yards. Grantham's Stuart Wilson flashed a 49th minute header into the side-netting from Bull's corner and on 58 minutes Ranshaw crashed a 20-yard free-kick high over the bar after Gary Bauress had handled on the edge of the box.</p>
  <p>HINES hit the crucial winning goal for Halesowen in the 71st minute when he headed home from close range at the far post as Richard Leadbeater headed-on a right-wing cross from Williams. In a tense finish Clarke collected a tame 20-yard shot from Wilson a minute later but it was Halesowen who had the better chances to increase the lead. On 85 minutes Ashby broke down the left and cleverly crossed across goal but the unmarked Leadbeater blasted over the bar from 6 yards out. A minute later Ashby broke again but this time hit straight at Ziccardi. The final whistle brought relief and renewed hope in a game that the result meant much more than the performance.</p>

    <h3>DMC Final 1L  Yeltz 2 Crawley 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The gloss was taken off a late comeback victory in the League Cup Final when results elsewhere meant we're now 4 points from safety with only four games remaining.</p>
  <p>Despite going behind midway through the second-half, our remarkable cup form continued with a late equaliser from Big Rich Leadbeater, and an even later own goal winner which sets up the second leg very nicely. However with Grantham and Hinckley winning, our fate is out of our own hands now even if we win Saturday's crucial game at The Grove against Grantham.</p>
  <p>
    include Hastings at Folkestone and Hednesford at Hinckley, so it's absolutely essential we take all three points. We really do have to do everything to encourage the team, so let's stay positive and roar the lads on to victory. Come On! Come On!

  <p>Halesowen turned the game on its head with two goals in the last three minutes to take a narrow advantage into the second leg of the cup final.</p>
  <p>Even prior to the game Halesowen were the only unbeaten team left in the competition (work that one out!). The Yeltz elected to continue with the squad system of previous rounds but with Crawley playing their strongest team it was the visitors who won two corners in the 6th minute with Nic McDonnell heading just wide. Crawley goalkeeper Andy Little then raced off his line in the 16th minute with Mark Danks about to pounce on Phil Trainer's through ball.</p>
  <p>In even exchanges Crawley's McDonnell headed Nigel Brake's cross straight at Halesowen goalkeeper Gary Hateley in the 22nd minute and five minutes later visiting defender Marc Pullan hoofed away a Danks cross from the right for a corner. Danks then rounded Little but was forced wide and he could only send over a weak cross. On the half-hour a Richard Colwell cross flicked off Ian Payne to land on the roof of Crawley's net. A minute before half-time Danks hit a 20-yard free-kick straight at Little and Richard Leadbeater turned Pullan but rolled the ball wide of goal.</p>
  <p>Crawley stepped up the pace in the second half and in the 50th minute McDonnell blasted a 20-yard effort just behind Hateley's goal and then headed a cross straight at Hateley seconds later. Andy Spencer screwed a 55th minute corner from Les Hines behind the goal and at the other end Mo Harkin's shot deflected into the path of Warren Bagnall but he shot wide of the mark. Ellis Hooper then blasted a loose ball over the Halesowen bar after Hateley failed to gather cleanly but Crawley went on to take a 60th minute lead with BAGNALL converting Ben Judge's corner from close range at the far post.</p>
  <p>With the Reds on top Hateley made a fine save as Stewart Holmes headed a Brake cross in the 63rd minute and seconds later Ernie Cooksey rattled the post with a powerful header from Harkin's corner. Hines was forced to concede a corner in the 73rd minute with McDonnell advancing on goal and Cooksey again headed on Judge's kick.</p>
  <p>With Crawley seemingly heading to victory Lee Williams put fellow substitute Jason Ashby free only to see Little save with his feet but LEADBEATER levelled the scores by heading home the resulting 87th minute corner from Williams. Crawley were stunned when the Yeltz hit the winning goal of the first leg just a minute later when Leadbeater broke down the right and the unfortunate JUDGE could only turn the cross into his own net with Trainer advancing. With the 4th Official showing 3 minutes added time on the electronic scoreboard, Hateley touched away a late shot from substitute Jamie Taylor.</p>
  <p>Despite the relieving diversion of Cup football, further wins on the evening by fellow relegation candidates Grantham and Hinckley proved of more concern to the already perilous league position.</p>
  <p>The second leg takes place on Tuesday 29th April at the Broadfield Stadium, Crawley, kick-off 7.45pm.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Welling United: Knight; Burgess, O'Shea, Hone, Edwards (Hogg 68), &#xD;
Farley, Riviere, Watts, Abbott, Booth (Jones 88), Aboagye. Unused Subs: &#xD;

  <p>Halesowen slipped to third from bottom after throwing away a promising &#xD;
half-time lead at Welling.</p>
  <p>Tim Clarke collected Gary Abbott's 2nd minute shot as the striker fell &#xD;
to the ground but Halesowen won the first corner on 6 minutes with &#xD;
Russell Edwards clearing the kick from Lee Williams.</p>
  <p>Halesowen then took a 9th minute lead when Mark Hone missed heading away &#xD;
a long clearance allowing Jason ASHBY to nip in and chip goalkeeper Glen &#xD;
Knight from 10 yards. Gary Bauress then suffered a head injury requiring &#xD;
stitches but battled on bravely with a bandage and Phil Trainer played a &#xD;
neat one-two for Michael Blackwood to strike wide of the post on 14 &#xD;
minutes. Clarke beat out Welling's first corner on 15 minutes but &#xD;
Halesowen were well on top and an 18th minute cross from Blackwood was &#xD;
met on the volley by Williams with Knight on hand to save. Blackwood &#xD;
then robbed Tim O'Shea in his own area but screwed his 5-yard shot wide &#xD;
in the 20th minute and three minutes later Knight beat away an 18-yard &#xD;
curling effort from Neil Gibson for a corner with the Wings flapping &#xD;
under sustained pressure.</p>
  <p>The second-half proved a different story with Welling playing more &#xD;
positively. Clarke failed to gather a 50th minute cross but Les Hines &#xD;
turned the ball away for a corner. Bauress headed the resulting corner &#xD;
from John Farley off his goal-line following a back-header at the near &#xD;
post. There was more than a hint of fortune about Welling's leveller on &#xD;
56 minutes when a 25-yard shot from Ray ABOAGYE took a cruel deflection &#xD;
to land in the corner of Clarke's net and a minute later an Abbott &#xD;
strike landed inches over Clarke's bar.</p>
  <p>Ashby curled a 62nd minute effort at Knight and Blackwood weaved through &#xD;
to shoot wide but Welling went on to gain the upper hand and cruised to &#xD;
victory with two late goals. In the 73rd minute ABBOTT stole in behind &#xD;
the Halesowen defence to head home Anthony Hogg's long free-kick at the &#xD;
far post. Hogg then struck the side-netting before Paul BOOTH beat the &#xD;
offside-trap and outpaced Bauress down the centre to hit past Clarke &#xD;
from 15-yards in the 77th minute. With their precious points lost in a &#xD;
poor second-half performance Halesowen could only play out the remaining &#xD;
minutes with Blackwood hitting an 86th minute shot to earn a corner.</p>

    Despite (because of?!) putting out a team including quite a few non-regulars, we've built up a handy 2-0 lead in the first leg of the Worcester Senior Cup. Second half goals from  and  means we're strong favorites to clinch the trophy in a couple of weeks time.

  <p>Halesowen made themselves favourites to lift the Worcestershire Senior Cup with two late goals against ten-man Evesham.</p>
  <p>With their priority firmly to stave off relegation, the Yeltz stuck with the squad system employed in previous rounds and made seven changes from the previous Saturday's line-up.</p>
  <p>In the 3rd minute Richard Leadbeater latched onto a long ball but couldn't quite flick the ball over the advancing Tim Hart who saved with his fingertips. A minute later Paul West turned away Richard Colwell's cross for a corner.</p>
  <p>For Evesham, manager's son Scott Mullen headed a Kris Sage cross inches wide on 6 minutes but Halesowen created the main early chances and on 10 minutes Mark Danks fed Leadbeater to hit the net, but the strike was disallowed for offside. Gavin Stone then rose to meet a 16th minute Kirk Master corner but his header hit the underside of the bar before bouncing down and out to safety. Neil Smith back headed a 23rd minute corner into the penalty area, but Evesham again cleared and on 40 minutes Phil Trainer headed another corner inches over the bar. Two minutes before half-time Hart parried away a fierce 12-yard drive from Master. Master burst through again in the 52nd minute but Hart turned away his shot for a corner and then saved the resulting header from Stone.</p>
  <p>The tie turned in the 56th minute when Mullen was shown a straight red card for an "off the ball" incident with Colwell after Mark Wolsey had gone down on the edge of Halesowen's penalty area. Lee Williams replaced Andy Spencer in the 69th minute and the home-side eventually began to break down the Evesham defence. Danks set up Leadbeater to curl wide on 70 minutes before Halesowen took a 71st minute lead with LEADBEATER following up to turn home a rebound when Hart failed to hold Colwell's tremendous 25-yard volley. Halesowen extended their lead four minutes later when DANKS found space to hit a 25-yard drive beyond the reach of Hart.</p>
  <p>Stone made a poor pass out of defence in the 76th minute with Paul Oakey hitting inches wide. However, Halesowen had further chances to firmly stake their claim on the silverware and six minutes from time a neat interchange between Trainer and Williams put Master free but he hit wide from just 6 yards out.</p>
  <p>The second leg takes place at Common Road, Evesham on Wednesday 23rd April.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Hinckley 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A crucial game and the mighty Yeltz came up with the goods as we took all three points against relegation rivals Hinckley. Two first half goals from Jason and Neil Gibson set us on our way, but a goal back in the 70th minute by them led to a tense finale. Still we got the victory and that's all that matters.</p>
  <p>
    , Cambridge, Hednesford, Ilkeston and Weymouth won, and Chelmsford, Folkestone (now relegated), Grantham and Welling lost. What that all means is we're  but only one point behind Grantham. Exciting or what?
    
  </p>
  <p>In a brief interlude, Tuesday brings the first of four 'final' games with the Worcester senior Cup Final 1st Leg at home to Evesham. They're mid-table in the Western Division so we should be favorites, but I'd be surprised if we put out the first team given our current league position. Still it would be nice to win something this season so let's hope for a nice victory.</p>

  <p>Halesowen unravelled the Knitters in the relegation six-pointer with two early goals to record only their second league home win since Christmas.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz made the best start possible by taking a 5th minute lead when Michael Blackwood headed on a long ball out of defence for Jason ASHBY to slot past goalkeeper Tom Whittle from a narrow angle to claim his 17th goal of the campaign.</p>
  <p>Even better followed when the Yeltz went two goals ahead in the 13th minute with Neil GIBSON heading home his first goal for the club at the far post from a Lee Collins right-wing cross.</p>
  <p>The hard surface made defending difficult and Richard Colwell headed a Stuart Storer free-kick behind goal for a corner in the 16th minute and two minutes later Gavin Stone missed a header in his own penalty area.</p>
  <p>Hungry Halesowen nearly made it 3-0 in the 21st minute when Colwell's cross beat Simon Dakin and fell for Les Hines to roll the ball inches wide of Whittle's right-hand post.</p>
  <p>David Sadler prodded home a free-kick from close range for Hinckley in the 27th minute but the celebrations were short-lived when the referee's assistant raised his flag for offside. A minute before the interval Ashby met a Lee Williams corner but Whittle was right in-line to save.</p>
  <p>The second-half started quietly but Hinckley increasingly came into the game as the Yeltz protected their precious lead and a 62nd minute corner from Jamie Lenton rolled across the home area. Blackwood then cut in from the right and hit a 20-yard drive just wide in the 64th minute for Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Hinckley set-up a nervous finish by pulling a goal back in the 70th minute with SADLER stealing in to head home a left-wing cross. Blackwood produced a fingertip save from Whittle on 73 minutes but Halesowen had a let-off a minute later when Tim Clarke made a hash of a clearance and luckily saw the ball roll out of play for a corner that was volleyed just over the bar by Scott Voice. Gary Bauress and Clarke then got in each others way ten minutes from time with Bauress ending the hesitation by conceding a corner, but Halesowen were happy to play out the dying moments to register another vital three points towards safety.</p>

    <h3>WSC SF  Bromsgrove 1 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Our excellent cup form continues, with a 3-1 semi-final win against Bromsgrove, but results elsewhere in the league has taken the edge off a bit.</p>
  <p>
    Goals from Big Rich, Andy Spencer (unbelievably his first of the season) and Gavin Stone takes us through to a final which is against Evesham I believe. However in  Cambridge, Hinckley and Ilkeston all won, leaving us 3 points from safety with it all to do.
    
  </p>
  <p>This obviously makes Saturday's game against Hinckley absolutely vital - so let's do all we can to get behind the team to get those three points.</p>
</p>

  <p>Bromsgrove Rovers: Lowe; Benbow, Banner, Brookes, Beckett, Pope, Dyson (Burgess HT), Ford (Hyde 64), Palmer, P. Danks, Frost. Unused Subs: Clifton, Broadhurst, Hackett</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Hateley; Colwell, Trainer, Smith, Collins, Stone, Skidmore, Spencer, M. Danks, Leadbeater, Master. Unused Subs: Ashby, Blackwood, Charlton, Williams, Clarke</p>
  <p>Referee: J. Holbrook (Kidderminster)     Declared Attendance: 295</p>
  <p>Halesowen eased their way into their second cup final of the season after their squad players took an early two-goal lead.</p>
  <p>The visitors went ahead in the 10th minute when Phil Trainer intercepted on the left and played a long ball forward that was miscued by goalkeeper Matt Lowe allowing Richard LEADBEATER to poke the ball into an empty net from the edge of the area. A minute later Leadbeater headed inches wide of Lowe's post and on 18 minutes Kirk Master floated in a cross for the same striker to head straight at Lowe.</p>
  <p>Halesowen went two goals to the good in the 20th minute when Mark Danks burst down the right and his hard, low cross was deftly flicked into the net by Andy SPENCER for his first goal of the season. At the other end a Lee Collins back-header almost let in Les Palmer after 23 minutes.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen well on top, the difference between the two divisions was clearly highlighted and on the half-hour the impressive Trainer played the ball for Leadbeater to spin and set up Master but Lowe parried his fierce shot for a corner. Master then hit a 39th minute free-kick at Lowe from 30 yards out.</p>
  <p>Bromsgrove made a livelier start to the second half with full-debut goalkeeper Gary Hateley saving a 20-yard Palmer strike at the second attempt after the centre-forward burst from midfield in the 55th minute. The hosts gave themselves hope in the 62nd minute when Richard BURGESS pulled a goal back by flashing a header into the top corner under pressure from Gavin Stone after Palmer headed-on. Palmer volleyed over the bar on the turn from a long ball from Steve Pope on 65 minutes and Hateley held onto a 73rd minute drive from 25 yards from Mark Benbow in a good spell of pressure for Rovers.</p>
  <p>Gavin STONE wrapped up the tie for the Yeltz in the 85th minute by heading home directly from Master's free-kick. Three minutes from time Spencer almost beat Lowe to the ball from a quickly taken free-kick and Richard Colwell hit in the rebound from 20-yards but his effort was chested off the line. A minute from full-time a good chance from Master was deflected away for a corner by Lowe.</p>
  <p>Halesowen go forward to meet Evesham in the Worcestershire Senior Cup final to be played on a two-leg basis.</p>

    <h3>Tiverton 4 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    Despite being in contention for most of the game, two late goals meant we've slipped back into the  again.
    
  </p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Referee: S. Hollick (Plymouth) Attendance: 731</p>
  <p>Halesowen fell back into the dreaded drop-zone in a cruel finish to an impressive performance against their fellow double-Vase winners Tiverton.</p>
  <p>On the plus side, another couple of goals on their travels kept Halesowen as the highest scoring away team in the division - a statistic that only highlights the string of dismal failures back at the Grove that has caused their plight. With their rivals continuing to pick up points Halesowen will realistically now need to win three or four of their remaining six games to ensure Dr Martens Premier survival, just one season after returning as Western Champions.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started where they left off in previous away trips when Jason Ashby turned to strike the top of the Tiverton bar in the first minute. Chris Holloway burst forward for Tivvy after 5 minutes but was blocked by a packed defence who then easily coped with two corners from Paul Chenoweth.</p>
  <p>Jason Rees headed behind his own goal on 16 minutes for Halesowen's first corner and from the Lee Williams kick Collins rose above the defence only to see his header cleared off the line by Rees. The Yeltz took the lead when the ball was turned back into the area towards the head of Gavin Stone and Michael BLACKWOOD whipped the loose ball into the net on the volley from 5 yards out.</p>
  <p>Tivvy equalised just four minutes later when Steve Winter crossed from the right and the unmarked Phil EVERETT tapped home from close range. Richard Colwell headed out of defence on the half-hour for Scott Rogers to drive just past the post from 25 yards. The home side then went 2-1 ahead on 35 minutes when Rogers put in a good cross from the left and EVERETT hit his second goal with a low volley past Tim Clarke.</p>
  <p>Halesowen continued to press forward and the full-backs combined in the 40th minute when substitute Asa Charlton crossed for Colwell to head just wide. Two minutes later Rees failed to clear but Foster was fortunate that the ball bounced off Blackwood into safety. On the stroke of half-time Foster held onto a 25-yard drive from Les Hines.</p>
  <p>At the start of the second period Chenoweth hit a well worked free-kick wide from 20 yards and Steve Ovens broke from midfield to hit the side-netting. But with Halesowen controlling large tracts of the game they deservedly levelled in the 69th minute when Lee COLLINS thundered a header past Foster from a Williams free-kick after substitute Mark Danks was fouled. With the visitors seeking a winner in open play, a Hines free-kick was blocked by the Tiverton wall and on 77 minutes Danks fed Blackwood but he scuffed his shot over the bar.</p>
  <p>Despite all their hard work Halesowen conceded two late goals in a sickening finale. On 88 minutes Stone was too intricate on the ball and let in ROGERS to flash a 20 yard effort into the top corner, despite Clarke managing to reach the ball with his fingertips. One minute into injury time Paul Edwards broke down the left and crossed for fellow substitute James MUDGE to convert a flattering fourth.</p>
  <p>Substitute goalkeeper came on in the outfield for Gavin Stone in the 92nd&#xD;
minute for just 30 seconds in order to make him eligible for the&#xD;
Worcestershire Senior Cup Semi-Final tie against his former club Bromsgrove&#xD;
Rovers.</p>

    <h3>Worcester 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    A late equaliser by new bloke  gained an important point against local rivals Worcester. We're unbeaten in four games against them this season, and we've climbed out of the bottom four for the first time this year. More details in .

</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Worcester City: McDonnell; Davies, Carty, Heeley, Shail, Holloway, Middleton, Counsell (Jones 60), Webster, Hadley (Owen 65), Wilde. Unused Subs: Parker, McDonald, Wyatt</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Charlton, Gibson, Collins, Stone, Williams, Ashby, Danks (Hines HT), McHugh, Blackwood. Unused Subs: Smith, Leadbeater, Master, Spencer</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Cairns (Northampton) Attendance: 817 Booked: Holloway (27), Wilde (84), Shail (88)</p>
  <p>Halesowen fought back from an early Worcester goal with another impressive away performance to claim a deserved and important point.</p>
  <p>Once more Halesowen fans were left scratching their heads with their favourites turning in an exciting performance barely recognisable from recent offerings at the Grove. The draw means that Halesowen remain unbeaten in the four meetings between the local rivals this season.</p>
  <p>In the second minute Daren Middleton thumped a shot at Tim Clarke's chest before the home side took a 6th minute lead when Adam Wilde crossed from the left and Adam WEBSTER with his back to goal turned to fire home from 5 yards out.</p>
  <p>Yet far from signalling a home rout, the resilient Yeltz kept the home side at bay and fought their way back into the game with Worcester barely registering any further shots on target.</p>
  <p>Mark Danks could have done better on 20 minutes when he beat the offside trap but he mis-controlled the ball and Danny McDonnell was able to block. Michael Blackwood had an impressive game in midfield and played two incisive balls through the Worcester defence in the 23rd minute with Jason Ashby hitting just wide. On the half-hour Paul Carty cleared a dangerous Lee Williams free-kick.</p>
  <p>Danks was replaced by Les Hines at the interval with Blackwood moving up front as the Yeltz took the game by the scruff of the neck and stroked the ball confidently around the park. One minute into the second half Lee Collins was unfortunate to see Allan Davies clear his header off the goal-line. Webster hit just past the angle in the 50th minute for Worcester and on 66 minutes former-Yeltz goalkeeper McDonnell was fortunate to escape the attentions of Ashby and Blackwood. Middleton's strike was well saved by Tim Clarke in a Worcester breakaway a minute later. But it was Halesowen who finished strongly and in the 80th minute a long Clarke kick saw Ashby feed Williams and when his shot was saved Fraser McHugh hit the rebound high.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz were finally rewarded with a precious equaliser for their hard work in the 87th minute when Ashby headed on another long Clarke goal-kick for BLACKWOOD to clinically clip the ball over McDonnell from 15 yards. With hungry Halesowen well on top, Collins struck a half-volley which trickled wide moments before the final whistle was greeted with loud ovation from the travelling fans.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Bath 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>What is it with our home form? We gained a useful point against Bath, coming back from behind through a Gavin Stone goal, but it's yet another non-win at The Grove.</p>
  <p>
    Looking through the results this season, the breakdown is...
    
  </p>
  <p>The other big news of the week is the announcement of the Conference reorganisation. It appears only one team will be relegated from the Conf. this season, and in 2004-05 there will be a Conference North and South. It's not exactly clear what this means for us, but right now it's even more important we stay up this year. No additional pressure there then.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Charlton, Skidmore, Collins, Stone, L. Williams, Ashby, Danks (Leadbeater 65), McHugh, Blackwood. Unused Subs: Hines, Gibson, Smith, Master.</p>
  <p>Bath City: Glassup; Bennett (Tweddle 65), Trought, Coupe, Kemp, Rollo, Gosling (Shore 82), Milsom, Eaton, Toomey (James 67), A. Williams. Unused Subs: Cleverley, Honor</p>
  <p>Referee: J. Hubbard (Leicester) Attendance: 507 Booked: Blackwood (34) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Gavin Stone</p>
  <p>A much-needed home win continued to prove elusive but the Yeltz battled back to draw after being second-best to Bath early on. With fellow relegation candidates Hastings, Hinckley and Weymouth all beaten, the point was another small stepping stone towards safety from relegation.</p>
  <p>Tim Clarke clawed away a Jason Eaton header from an Andy Williams cross in the 8th minute when the ball bounced off the hard surface. Halesowen had trouble breaking down their stubborn visitors, only managing one attempt on goal in the first half when a Lee Collins header was grabbed by stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Glassup under his crossbar from the first corner on 20 minutes.</p>
  <p>The visitors enjoyed a good spell of pressure late in the first-half to leave Halesowen grateful to be level at the half-time whistle. On 28 minutes Paul Milsom played a ball over the top to put Dave Toomey clear on goal but Clarke raced out of goal to make a fine blocking save. Four minutes later James Gosling hit a 25-yard volley inches wide and in the 36th minute Toomey's shot was deflected for a corner by Richard Colwell with the Yeltz struggling to get the ball free from their own area.</p>
  <p>Bath were almost caught cold a minute into the second half by a quickly taken Lee Williams free-kick allowing Fraser McHugh to surge in to the area but Glassup saved on the line and a minute later Glassup pushed away a Collins header. Ex-Stevenage midfielder Michael Blackwood then put the ball high over the bar from a Mark Danks cross on the hour.</p>
  <p>Almost inevitably, Bath took the lead in the 62nd minute when MILSOM was allowed to run through the home defence and he turned in the area to hit past Clarke from 15 yards. With the clock ticking away and little sign of an improvement in Halesowen's penetration, Gavin STONE rose above the Bath defence to flash home a header into the roof of the net from a Lee Williams corner to put the Yeltz back on level terms.</p>
  <p>The goal ignited Halesowen's self-belief and urgency and Bath weathered a difficult last quarter of an hour. Stone headed just high in the 75th minute and substitute Richard Leadbeater side-footed a rebound wide from 20 yards when Jason Ashby challenged Glassup in the 83rd minute. Five minutes from time McHugh burst up the field for Lee Williams to cross to Ashby, but his shot was blocked by Jim Rollo.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Newport 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    After two excellent victories away from home, the mighty Yeltz fell back to earth with a disappointing 2-1 loss at The Grove against Newport. Despite taking the lead just before half-time through Jason, they drew level just after the break and then got a winner with 10 minutes to go. Full details in .

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Hines, Bauress (Trainer 71), L. Collins, Stone, Williams, Ashby, Danks (Leadbeater 64), McHugh, Skidmore. Unused Subs: Master, Spencer, Charlton</p>
  <p>Newport County: Wesson; C. Collins, Benton, Clark (Thomas HT), Perry, Eckhardt, Rose, Nathan Davis, Neil Davis (Plant 90), Shepherd, Dimond. Unused Subs: French, Stevenson, Idzi</p>
  <p>Referee: D. Brockwell (Northampton) Attendance: 555 Booked: None Sponsors' Man of the Match: Frazer McHugh</p>
  <p>Halesowen's run of good form came to an abrupt end by letting a first half lead slip against out-of-form Newport to produce yet another disappointing home result.</p>
  <p>In an even opening, a Kristian Dimond cross from the right fell for the unmarked Steve Benton in the 6th minute but he volleyed wide while at the other end Jason Perry kept out a Lee Williams cross with a diving header to concede a 10th minute corner. After 25 minutes Tim Clarke dropped a Dimond corner but Lee Collins was on hand to clear off the line and a minute later Neil Davis volleyed high from 10 yards for County.</p>
  <p>With the game played at a lightning pace on a hard surface, stand-in novice Newport goalkeeper Gareth Wesson raced out to gather from the on-rushing Jason Ashby on the half-hour and Mark Danks sent in a 15-yard shot across the ground 8 minutes later.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz took the lead at an ideal time just a minute before the break when a long punt out of defence found ASHBY and he turned his marker on the left of the area to beat Wesson with a shot along the ground.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's joy was short-lived when they allowed Newport to equalise in the first minute of the second half with a 15-yard shot from Gary SHEPHERD rolling into the corner of the net with Clarke late seeing the ball. On the hour Danks fed Ashby on the break but he shot weakly at Wesson and in the 63rd minute Frazer McHugh's 20-yard shot was deflected for a corner that was headed high by Lee Collins. In a lightning 65th minute move Les Hines crossed for his fellow full-back Richard Colwell to meet the ball with a diving header but Wesson made a point-blank save.</p>
  <p>In end-to-end play Neil Davis then went close twice for Newport in the 69th minute by dispossessing Colwell to hammer a 25-yard shot that beat Clarke but rebounded off the inside of the post and from the following cross Davis then headed onto the roof of the net.</p>
  <p>Halesowen re-organised themselves in the 74th minute with Phil Trainer replacing Gary Bauress and the pivotal moment of the game arrived five minutes later. In the 78th minute Wesson pulled off another fine reflex save from Leadbeater after Ashby flicked on a Williams cross and as the ball broke down the other end DIMOND headed a left-wing cross strongly past Clarke from close range to register Newport's first win since January and sink Halesowen back into trouble.</p>

Charity, Walker, Horgan, Paul (Godley 90), Mings, Griffin (Rawlins 81). &#xD;
Unused Sub: Bull</p>

  <p>Referee: R. Green (Berkeley, Glos.) Attendance: 605 Booked: None</p>
  <p>Rejuvenated Halesowen reeled off their third straight away win to haul &#xD;
themselves closer to safety and extend their unbeaten run to five games.</p>
  <p>Halesowen weathered some early Chippenham pressure and slack defending &#xD;
allowed Charlie Griffin to nip in and head a Gary Horgan free-kick &#xD;
against the cross-bar in the 2nd minute. Lee Collins then cleared a &#xD;
Scott Walker cross from the left and in the 5th minute Adie Mings &#xD;
miscued his shot from the edge of the box when well placed.</p>
  <p>An 11th minute Les Hines free-kick was met by a Gavin Stone header but &#xD;
goalkeeper James Bittner scurried across his goal to make a fingertip &#xD;
save. Home skipper Colin Towler then cleared off his goal-line when Mark &#xD;
Danks took down a 14th minute right wing cross to shoot on target.</p>
  <p>Chippenham's direct approach continued to cause problems up the slope &#xD;
and Gary Bauress was forced to clear over his own bar in the 16th &#xD;
minute. Simon Charity then hit wide from 20 yards and Griffin lobbed &#xD;
over the bar in the 23rd minute.</p>
  <p>Jason Ashby nipped in to latch onto a long ball from Lee Williams in the &#xD;
25th minute but Bittner rushed out to make an acrobatic block. After a &#xD;
stoppage for injury to Bittner, Danks then turned in the area to produce &#xD;
a reflex stop from the keeper and in the 32nd minute Ashby almost &#xD;
connected after neat play by Danks and Williams. At the other end Tim &#xD;
Clarke grabbed Horgan's shot at the second attempt in the 42nd minute.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz then blasted the Bluebirds with a two-goal salvo in the final &#xD;
minute of the first half. Halesowen took the lead in the 45th minute &#xD;
with their own route-one style when a long ball from Danks bounced over &#xD;
Wayne Thorne and WILLIAMS lobbed the goalkeeper from 15 yards. Seconds &#xD;
later, STONE was on hand to touch home a right wing cross from close &#xD;
range that had escaped Collins under pressure to take a 2-0 half-time &#xD;
lead that looked unlikely just minutes earlier.</p>
  <p>Five minutes into the second half a stunned Chippenham could only watch &#xD;
when a Collins header hit the crossbar with Horgan standing on the line. &#xD;
However, Chippenham pulled a goal back in the 57th minute with Scott &#xD;
Walker rifling home the loose ball from 18 yards after Clarke had failed &#xD;
to hold a deep cross from the left under pressure following Tom Gould's &#xD;
30-yard free-kick. Three minutes later Griffin headed inches over the &#xD;
bar as it seemed the home side were about to apply the pressure down the &#xD;
slope.</p>
  <p>However, with Frazer McHugh and Williams pulling the strings in midfield &#xD;
the Yeltz were never seriously troubled in the final half-hour despite &#xD;
seven minutes of injury-time. Mings drove wide from the left in the 70th &#xD;
minute before Bittner collected a 75th minute curling free-kick from &#xD;
Hines.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's controlled and neat passing almost created a third goal in &#xD;
the 76th minute with McHugh hitting the outside of the angle as Danks &#xD;
and substitute Richard Leadbeater broke through the home defence. Five &#xD;
minutes from time Clarke tipped away a left-wing cross from Martin Paul &#xD;
for a corner, but the Yeltz easily held on to record a splendid win and &#xD;
condemn Chippenham to their first home league defeat since August.</p>
