    <h3>Dover 0 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In a fantastic and totally unexpected way, we're right back in with a chance of staying up after a stunning 3-0 victory away at Dover. Another goal from Mark Danks followed by two from Frazer (one a penalty) hasn't moved us up  the table  but we're now only in the bottom four on goal difference - which has been much-improved tonight.</p>
  <p>Another tough game on Saturday when we visit 2nd place  <a href="http://www.chippenhamtownfc.co.uk/">Chippenham</a> . Now obviously we beat them in the Cup last week so we must have a chance, and let's hope we can continue our excellent run of late and pick up another point or three.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Cambridge 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We really needed three points today, and although most other results went for us we're still  three points from safety  with a game in hand. It was looking a lot worse when we went behind just before half-time, but came back through another excellent goal from Mark Danks.</p>
  <p>On Monday we make the long journey down to  <a href="http://www.doverathletic.net/">Dover</a>  to play that game in hand. It's going to be very difficult, but we gave them a good game at The Grove earlier in the season so let's hope we can get something out of the game.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell (Leadbeater 75), Hines, Bauress, Collins, Stone, Williams, Ashby, Danks, McHugh, Skidmore. Unused Subs: Master, Charlton, Trainer, Spencer</p>
  <p>Cambridge City: Davies; Wignall, Wardley, Wooding, Vowden, Sturgess, Niven, Hayes, Gutzmore, Bloomfield (Paynter 88), Simpson (Wilkin 75). Unused Subs: Rice, Huggins, Calton</p>
  <p>Referee: T. J. Sim (Burton) Attendance: 506 Booked: Stone (34)</p>
  <p>A crucial relegation six-pointer ended all-square and although another failure to beat a lower table side at home was a disappointment, the second half equaliser still provided hope of escaping the bottom four.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started confidently, looking to build on an excellent week that saw a 3-1 victory at Ilkeston followed by their progression to the Dr Martens Cup Final by defeating high-flying Chippenham. On loan Bantam Mark Danks forced a 5th minute corner and then skipped through the Cambridge defence on 12 minutes but saw his teasing shot fall just wide of goal. Goalkeeper Tim Clarke easily collected a 16th minute effort from Cambridge full-back Jack Wignall and two minutes later Frazer McHugh superbly turned his marker from a Gavin Stone cross but shot inches wide.</p>
  <p>Cambridge came back strongly in the 25th minute and Clarke could only punch Stuart Niven's corner under challenge by Robbie Simpson and the ball landed for Leon Gutzmore on the line but Richard Colwell was on hand to make a vital clearance. On 28 minutes a Les Hines free-kick was turned away for a corner taken by Lee Williams with the ball breaking for Hines to volley from 25 yards and force a spectacular save from Martin Davies.</p>
  <p>The visitors took a 39th minute lead when NIVEN beat off the challenges of Stuart Skidmore and Lee Collins in the area to fire past Clarke from 10 yards. A minute before the break the visitors went close again with Simpson just inches from meeting a Gutzmore cross with his attempt at a diving header as Halesowen endured their worst 15-minute spell of the game after falling behind. Just thirty seconds into the second-half Clarke turned a 15-yard shot from Adie Hayes around the post.</p>
  <p>However, the Yeltz then battled back into the game and created a number of chances before deservedly equalising. On 53 minutes Colwell won the ball in midfield and fed Jason Ashby on the left, but McHugh couldn't find enough power in his header from Ashby's cross to beat Davies against the blustery wind. On the hour Gary Bauress linked up with Williams to put McHugh through on goal but his dipping 20-yard shot fell just over the bar. Five minutes later Halesowen missed their best chance so far when Ashby chested down a Williams cross to leave himself clear on goal but he missed the target from 12 yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat.</p>
  <p>Halesowen eventually levelled on 67 minutes when Williams drove through the Cambridge defence and the ball broke for DANKS to fire home just inside the post from the edge of the penalty area. Brendan Philips then gambled for a winner with 15 minutes remaining by replacing full-back Colwell with striker Richard Leadbeater.</p>
  <p>Both sides had late chances to win the game although the draw was a fair outcome. Ashby beat his marker but drove wide in the 79th minute, a 20-yard Williams drive then drifted just wide and Collins headed over the bar for Halesowen while Danny Bloomfield missed a good opportunity for Cambridge by firing high in space from 10 yards in the 85th minute. A minute from full-time Danks almost stole in between Davies and Wooding but hit the side-netting from a tight angle.</p>

    <h3>DMC SF  Yeltz 2 Chippenham 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Despite our poor league form we've been mostly excellent in Cups this season, and we continued in that vein to reach the League Cup final through a 2-1 victory against Chippenham. After going behind in the first half, we came back through 2 pens from Fraser McHugh to earn a well-deserved victory.</p>
  <p>The final will be against Crawley, but I'm not sure about the format yet - never paid much attention to the competition this far to be honest. I'm sure someone will let me know.</p>
  <p>More good news tonight when relegation rivals Hastings lost at Bath, and if we can beat Cambridge on Saturday we'll be right back in the thick of things. Let's hope we can take some confidence from tonight into the rest of the season.</p>

    <h3>Ilkeston 1 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After the recent disappointments, it's great to report a victory against a poor Ilkeston side who look certain to go down. Goals from  <b>new bloke Mark Danks</b>  (he scored for Bradford against the Albion in the Cup), a McHugh penalty ( view video  - thanks to Chris Davis) and a third from Jason has at least kept us within some sort of reach of safety.</p>
  <p>With all of the teams above us drawing we've 'closed' to  4 points of safety , and with Cambridge visiting The Grove next Saturday let's hope we can get even closer.</p>
  <p>However, we've got the distraction of a League Cup semi-final against Chips'n'ham on Tuesday. It would be great to beat them, but it really is a case of concentrating on the league at the moment.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Weymouth 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Two crucial games and two awful defeats. In what was probably a must win game, the mighty Yeltz lost 1-0 to Weymouth through a goal just before half-time. Full details in  Dave's match report .</p>
  <p>I can't remember being more depressed - even two years ago when we went down we could kid ourselves it was an aberration and we really are a Premier Division team, but at this moment in time it's hard to convince anyone that's true.</p>
  <p>Still onwards and upwards. We're at bottom-placed Ilkeston on Saturday so we can hope we can still turn the corner and get out of the bottom four. Three points really are essential this time.</p>
  <p>Positive vibes (if you can)</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Hines, Bauress (Trainer 78), Collins, Stone, Williams, Ashby, Master (Dunkley 61), McHugh, Skidmore. Unused Subs: Smith, Charlton, Leadbeater</p>
  <p>Weymouth: Matthews, Tully, S. Browne, A. Browne, Kenway, Bailey, Robinson, Hutchinson, Sullivan, Laws, Phillips. Unused Subs: Ashford, Whiteman, Sajic, Hale</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Henley (Cradley) Attendance: 294 Booked: Skidmore (7)</p>
  <p>Halesowen's season continued to deteriorate into a haunting re-run of their relegation two years ago as they failed to score for the 10th time in 15 home league games.</p>
  <p>A poor advert for Dr Martens Premier football saw Weymouth bounce back from a 4-1 thrashing at bottom side Ilkeston to jump out of the relegation zone in a must-win game for the two relegation threatened teams.</p>
  <p>Stuart Skidmore received a 7th minute booking for an over-eager challenge but with much-changed Halesowen continuing where they left off the previous Saturday against Chelmsford, it wasn't until the half hour that the Weymouth defence was troubled in a five-minute spell of pressure.</p>
  <p>On 28 minutes Mark Kenway headed over his own bar and from the corner Lee Collins saw his effort grabbed at the second attempt by goalkeeper Jason Matthews at the base of the post. A minute later Jason Ashby broke and crossed from the left but Kirk Master's header was off-target and Lee Williams hit the loose ball over the bar in what proved to be Halesowen's best chance of the night. A Collins header was then cleared off the goal-line by Danny Bailey from a Williams corner.</p>
  <p>Weymouth then went on to enjoy their own best spell with a Lee Phillips header bouncing just over the bar from Steve Tully's cross on 33 minutes. Martyn Sullivan weaved into the Halesowen area after 38 minutes but missed the goal and recently-returned favourite striker David Laws put the loose ball wide. A minute later Sullivan's 15-yard shot forced a one-handed reflex save from Tim Clarke. Almost inevitably, Weymouth grabbed the decisive goal in the 40th minute when PHILLIPS took advantage of sloppy defending to fire home from the edge of the box.</p>
  <p>As in recent performances, Halesowen heads dropped after falling behind in a second half bereft of entertainment. Williams curled a 55th minute shot straight at Matthews but it was the Terras who could have increased the lead on 65 minutes when Ian Hutchison set up Laws, but he blasted high from a good position. Three minutes from full-time Matthews made a fine blocking save from substitute Phil Trainer after a Les Hines corner with the final whistle being greeted with silence from the lowest ever Grove attendance in the Southern Premier League.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Chelmsford 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In a game critical to our chances of avoiding relegation, the mighty Yeltz went down 2-0 to fellow strugglers Chelmsford City at The Grove. Two first-half goals means we're still 5 points from safety and on current form looking a good bet to go straight back down. Full match details in  DJ's match report .</p>
  <p>All this makes Tuesday's game at home to  <b>Weymouth</b>  even more important. We stuffed them 4-1 earlier in the season, and if we can't get three points against them I just can't see any way we can stay up. No pressure there then.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: T. Clarke; Colwell, Charlton (Trainer 52), Bauress, Collins, Stone, Williams, Ashby, May (Leadbeater 52), McHugh, Hines. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Smith, Master.</p>
  <p>Chelmsford City: Nicholls; Statham, Cousins, Basham, Wiles, Slatter (Reid 84), Cross, Rutherford, Dean, Watkins (Samuels 73), Berkley. Unused Subs: S. Clarke, Lay, Lakin</p>
  <p>Referee: G. Law (Leicester) Attendance: 462 Booked: Charlton (39)</p>
  <p>Despite their early dominance goal-shy Halesowen were hit by two goals just before half-time in a smash-and-grab raid by the Chelmsford forwards.</p>
  <p>Desperately needing a win to bolster their league position, Halesowen started brightly and on-loan Lee Williams latched onto a 2nd minute defensive slip but fired high from a good position. Williams then flicked on a right-wing cross to Jason Ashby on 15 minutes but the young striker hit the side-netting from two yards as he attempted to round goalkeeper Paul Nicholls, who was injured in the process. A deep 19th minute cross from Williams was then met by Leroy May's header but the struggling Nicholls managed to grab the ball.</p>
  <p>At the other end, Tim Clarke grabbed an Ian Cousins free-kick and then easily took the ball as Chelmsford won two 20th minute corners.</p>
  <p>Hungry Halesowen were well on top at this stage and continued to create chances with a 22nd minute Williams volley drifting just wide from a Les Hines cross. Frazer McHugh then shot inches wide on 24 minutes and a minute later looked certain to score but was denied on the line by Gary Cross after Ashby helped the ball on. Cross was then unlucky to see the ball flash past Halesowen's post when his shot took a nasty deflection off skipper Lee Collins.</p>
  <p>On the half-hour Collins could only head weakly past the post from a Hines corner before the Yeltz were punished for missing their chances. Chelmsford's stunned the home crowd by taking a 32nd minute lead when Dale Watkins crossed from the left for the unmarked Phil DEAN to steal in and head past Clarke, despite Clarke almost making a spectacular stop.</p>
  <p>Asa Charlton received a booking as frustration grew and in the 40th minute May powered a header wide of the mark from another Hines cross. Worse followed for the Yeltz in the 43rd minute when slack defending allowed Austin Berkley to find WATKINS and the experienced striker hammered home from 8 yards to increase the lead.</p>
  <p>Halesowen heads dropped alarmingly in the second period and injured City goalkeeper Nicholls was never seriously tested despite an early double substitution. With Chelmsford looking comfortable with their lead, Watkins curled just wide on the hour and then influential midfielder Danny Slatter forced a low save from Clarke on 80 minutes.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's final opportunity arrived 8 minutes from time from a great Williams cross but both Ashby and Leadbeater waited too long to fire the trigger from close range and the danger was cleared.</p>

    <p>
  <p>With the freezing weather cancelling the League Cup semi-final against Chippenham (provisionally rearranged for March 4th), we need to pick up some points in the League very quickly.</p>
  <p>We've got an excellent chance to do just that, with the next 3 games against Chelmsford and Weymouth at The Grove and then Ilkeston away. We can, and probably must, take 9 points from those games, so it's really the crucial part of what's been a difficult season so far. However I've still got every confidence we can do it. Come on!</p>

  <p>We travelled in hope of a point but ended up being completely overrun by a half-decent team.</p>

Two more very poor goals from rubbish defending plus a sending off for Asa Charlton meant our mini-revival was emphatically over, and with Weymouth winning again we're now  5 points from safety .</p>

    <h3>DMC  Bedworth 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Our excellent cup form continued as the mighty Yeltz reached their second semi-final this year with a 2-0 victory over Bedworth in the League Cup. A first minute goal from new bloke  <b>Lee Williams</b>  and a last minute one from  <b>Kirk</b>  took us through to play  <b>Chips'n'ham next Tuesday at The Grove</b> , despite what everyone previously thought - the other semi is now Chelmsford vs. King's Lynn.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us to  <a href="http://www.crawley-town-fc.co.uk/">Crawley</a>  in an important league game (aren't they all?). They've slipped down to halfway recently - they were second just after they easily beat us in September - so let's be hopeful of picking up something from the game.</p>
  <p>P.S. There's a new vote on whether you think we'll stay up or not.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bedworth United: R. Williams; McGregor, Crowley (D. Williams 27), Everitt, Richardson, Hood, Steane, Kelly, O'Toole (McVarish 15), Ross, Whitmore (Abercrombie 72). Unused Subs: Gibson, Iyayi</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Adamson; Medou-Otye, Charlton, Smith, Stone, Trainer (Skidmore 70), L. Williams, Master, Leadbeater (Ashby 72), McHugh, Hines. Unused Subs: Colwell, Collins.</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Scarr (Rubery)</p>
  <p>Halesowen progressed with goals in the first and last minutes but missed a whole host of good chances in between. The victory lined-up a semi-final against the winners of the Kings Lynn and Grantham tie.</p>
  <p>Showing six changes from Saturday, the Yeltz went ahead within seconds of the start when classy Lee WILLIAMS curled the ball around goalkeeper Richard Williams from the edge of the box. Lee Williams had the goalkeeper in all sorts of trouble again four minutes later when his right-wing cross struck the far post.</p>
  <p>Chris Adamson beat away a 20-yard shot from Scott McGregor in the 12th minute when Neil Smith lost possession in midfield and then raced smartly off his line to dive at the feet of ex-Yeltz striker Lee Ross as Ben Steane took a quick free-kick.</p>
  <p>On 32 minutes Kirk Master beat his marker but chipped just the wrong side of the post and seconds later Richard Leadbeater screwed just wide of the left upright. Three minutes before the break Adamson grabbed a Paul Kelly header with ease.</p>
  <p>Leadbeater missed a great opportunity five minutes into the second half when he weakly hit the post from close range following a good cross from the right by Master. Bedworth broke straight down the other end and Ross met a deep cross from Steane with substitute Ian McVarish blasting wide from 2 yards out. In a spell of home pressure, a 54th minute cross from McGregor needed just a touch from Ross, but Asa Charlton was able to clear before Charlton headed off the line again a minute later.</p>
  <p>Halesowen should have increased their lead but were denied by a combination of poor finishing and good goalkeeping. In the 63rd minute a cross from Parfait Medou-Otye was screwed wide by Master and three minutes later Richard Williams beat the ball away from Lee Williams after he raced into the box. On 68 minutes Master hit at Williams when put clear and Master found himself clear again two minutes later but James Richardson got back well to clear off the line after Master had rounded goalkeeper Williams. A Lee Williams cross struck the top of the bar on 75 minutes and on 84 minutes Fraser McHugh was guilty of striking the side-netting when put free by Master. Five minutes from time Master looked offside but was allowed to proceed but again failed to beat Williams when clear on goal.</p>
  <p>The second goal finally arrived in the dying seconds when McHugh broke from midfield and although Williams saved again from substitute Jason Ashby the rebound fell for MASTER to turn home.</p>

  <p>Although we're still in big trouble, it's essential we pick up points against other teams at the bottom (and there are loads of them) especially at The Grove. Today we did just that with a 1-0 victory over Havant through an early Leroy May goal. Full details in  DJ's match report .</p>
  <p>We're still  20th in the table  with Weymouth winning as well, but we're now only 4 points from safety so it's still all to play for.</p>
  <p>There's been even more movement in the transfer market, with Ross Collins leaving (to the end of the season at least) and Lee Williams coming in from Cheltenham. Ross has been a fantastic servant for the club and it's a real shame to have to let him go, but let's hope all the recent signings can help us stay up.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Charlton, Skidmore, Collins, Stone, Williams, Ashby, L. May (Leadbeater 77), McHugh, Hines. Unused Subs: Master, Medou-Otye, Smith, Trainer</p>
  <p>Havant &amp; Waterlooville: Kerr, Masson, Ferrett (Leworthy 77), Davis, Hall, Hanson, Blake, Hambley, Howe (Hale HT), Taylor, Haughton. Unused Subs: Turner, Fennemore, S. May</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Weaver (Bearwood) Attendance: 429 Booked: Skidmore (19) Sponsors Man of the Match: Gavin Stone</p>
  <p>Halesowen notched an important first league win of 2003 to boost their chances of escaping from the relegation-danger zone.</p>
  <p>After an even opening Leroy MAY scored the early decisive goal in the 13th minute when he pulled away from his marker to power a header past goalkeeper Aaron Kerr from a Lee Williams cross. Five minutes later Jason Ashby set up Stuart Skidmore to side-foot over the bar from the edge of the area. Skidmore then received a booking for a foul on Robert Howe after being dispossessed, but Chris Ferrett blasted the free-kick against the Halesowen defensive wall. On-loan Cheltenham midfielder Lee Williams made all the difference with Halesowen continuing to push for goals and Kerr dived to save at his feet in the 22nd minute as he ran into the box on the heavily sanded surface.</p>
  <p>Havant won their first corner on the half-hour with Tim Clarke only punching out for Alec Masson to drive the ball towards goal but Les Hines made a crucial goal-line clearance. Kerr then kept out a 25-yard drive from the impressive Williams and Alec Masson cleared from Ashby after Richard Colwell played the ball into the area. Ten minutes before the break Gavin Stone made a timely headed clearance when Tim Hambley sent in a dangerous ball towards his fellow strikers.</p>
  <p>Halesowen sat back to soak up the Havant pressure at the start of the second period and they almost paid the price. Ferrett dug in a 50th minute left-wing cross that fell invitingly for James Taylor but the normally lethal striker miscued from close range allowing Tim Clarke to recover and save. Out of form Warren Haughton then skipped past the Halesowen defence to force a corner that Clarke gratefully grabbed at the second attempt.</p>
  <p>On the hour Kerr produced a reflex save to deny May's header from a Williams corner and six minute later Ashby sprung the offside trap but he hesitated too long with Christian Hanson able to clear the danger.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen needing to hang on to their slender lead Stone tripped Haughton on the edge of the box in the 73rd minute after Asa Charlton lost the ball, but Ferrett hit the free-kick weakly at Clarke. The visitors then gambled by introducing 40-year striker David Leworthy and they almost found an equaliser ten minutes from time when Neil Davis beat Clarke to a Gareth Hall chip but the ball fell inches wide.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz kept possession in the dying moments and should have added a second goal in the final minute when Ashby set up substitute Richard Leadbeater but Kerr made a fine double save from five yards.</p>

  <p>Halesowen ended their dismal run of defeats to notch a vital first win of 2003 in a low-key affair against old rivals Worcester City.</p>
  <p>With both sides showing a number of changes, Worcester's Stewart Hadley was only inches away from meeting a dangerous 6th minute cross by Dean Smith. Halesowen's Richard Leadbeater then went close three minutes later when he rounded Paul Wyatt but the goalkeeper recovered to make a fine save.</p>
  <p>Fluent football was difficult on the sticky playing surface but the Yeltz took a 13th minute lead when Fraser McHUGH took a direct free-kick near the left touch-line and the ball drifted across goal to evade a surprised Wyatt. Andy Spencer then side-stepped his marker in the 24th minute to drive at Wyatt from the edge of the box. Worcester equalised a minute before the break with Stewart HADLEY slotting past Tim Clarke after being put through on goal by Dean Smith.</p>
  <p>Darren Middleton chipped weakly at Clarke in the 49th minute after the home goalkeeper made a poor clearance before Kirk MASTER grabbed Halesowen's winning goal on 50 minutes by beating Wyatt with a low drive from the left following a flick-on by Leadbeater. Leadbeater then danced through the Worcester defence in the 69th minute but substitute Leroy May shot just wide. Six minutes from time a David Holmes effort was cleared off the goal-line by Neil Smith to ensure Halesowen's passage into the semi-final.</p>

    <h3>Tamworth 3 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>I think before the game we'd have expected a result like this, but to give us a little bit of hope by leading at half-time through  <b>Jason Ashby</b>  was a bit cruel. Unfortunately it was predictable they'd come back to win 3-1, and they are looking very good now to get promoted to the Conference.</p>
  <p>With both Weymouth and Hinckley getting a point, the  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=25012003"&gt;table</a>  makes even grimmer reading than usual. Read DJ's  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=25012003"&gt;match report</a>  for full details on the game.</p>
  <p>Next game is in the Worcester Senior Cup on Tuesday when we entertain Worcester at home. We've done well against them so far this season, so let's hope for a confidence-boosting result. We need one.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Tamworth: Davies; Warner, Follett, Robinson, Turner, Cooper, Evans, Atkinson, Hallam (Jephcott 67), D. Collins, McGorry. Unused Subs: Acton, Marsh, Haynes, Hanney</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Charlton, Skidmore, L. Collins, Stone, Spencer (Master 78), Ashby, May, McHugh, Hines. Unused Subs: Leadbeater, Medou-Otye, Newall, Adamson</p>
  <p>Referee: P. Martin (Northampton) Attendance: 1150 Booked: May (23),Skidmore (65), McGorry (65)</p>
  <p>Table topping Tamworth sent Halesowen crashing to their fourth straight defeat of 2003 despite being shocked by Ashby giving the Yeltz a half-time lead.</p>
  <p>Tamworth started brightly and debut defender Asa Charlton had to make a 2nd minute clearance from a free-kick floated in by Brian McGorry. Steve Evans then found a gap in the Yeltz defence and seemed certain to score but Charlton blocked again with Graeme Atkinson's resulting corner charged down in the 7th minute. A minute later a right wing cross from Evans was met with a clever flick by Atkinson to win yet another corner.</p>
  <p>For Halesowen, Tim Clarke grabbed another corner in the 12th minute and sent a long ball up the field for Jason Ashby to lob over the Tamworth bar. Andy Spencer then blasted a good opportunity well wide from 20 yards out. With the home pressure continuing, a 17th minute free-kick from captain Mark Cooper was deflected wide with the corner again scrambled clear.</p>
  <p>However it was Halesowen who silenced the Lambs by taking a 29th minute lead. Lee Collins earned Halesowen's first corner from a Charlton free-kick and with the ball only partly cleared, Charlton set up Les Hines to cross for ASHBY's header to creep past on-loan Birmingham City goalkeeper Clint Davies.</p>
  <p>Just before half-time an Atkinson free-kick from the right was cleared by the busy Halesowen defence and Darren Collins headed just wide from Robert Warner's cross.</p>
  <p>Spencer scuffed a 46th shot well wide from 25 yards before rampant Tamworth showed their title credentials by taking control with two goals in three minutes. After 52 minutes Mark Hallam headed on a right-wing cross leaving Darren COLLINS the simple task of rolling the ball into the net from two yards out. Three minutes later a right-wing cross caused an almighty goal-mouth scramble and although Gavin Stone looked to have cleared, the ball broke free for HALLAM to touch home from close range.</p>
  <p>The stunned visitors never looked likely to recover although Davies saved at the feet of Leroy May on the hour from a Hines cross. Tamworth kept up the late pressure with Hallam driving just wide after bursting through the heart of the Halesowen defence before being substituted in the 67th minute. Demoralised Halesowen fell further behind after 76 minutes when Darren COLLINS latched onto a left-wing cross from Atkinson.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes from time Ashby broke away but Hines lashed his shot from the left well over the bar from 20 yards and on full-time substitute Kirk Master cut in from the right but his shot drifted across the Tamworth goal.</p>

    <h3>BSC  Yeltz 1 Birmingham City 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>2 days later and it doesn't get any cheerier. We're now out of the B'ham Senior Cup, losing 3-1 at The Grove to Blues. We equalised through Phil Trainer after half-time, but lost to two late goals to a team that surprisingly enough had few stars on show.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us to  <a href="http://www.thelambs.co.uk/">Tamworth</a>  in what is potentially the hardest game of the season. Still, we have absolutely nothing to lose, so let's go all out to cause what would be a major upset. Stranger things have happened. Maybe.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Hines, Skidmore, Newall, Stone, Spencer (L. Collins HT), Ashby (Master 65), Leadbeater (R. Collins 56), Brennan, Trainer. Unused Subs: Smith, Garvey</p>
  <p>Birmingham City: Flinders; Luntala (Beauchamp 56), Gilbert, Alsop, Hipkiss, Sadler, Carter (Cottrill 74), Grondin (Curtis 71), Barrowman, Allen, Capaldi. Unused Sub: Courtney.</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Penn (Wall Heath) Attendance: 402 Booked: None Sponsors' Man of the Match: Gavin Stone</p>
  <p>The difficult start to 2003 continued with Halesowen bowing out of the Birmingham Senior Cup in their third successive defeat of the New Year.</p>
  <p>Andrew BARROWMAN gave the Blues' youngsters a 12th minute lead by firmly heading home a cross from Danny Carter who broke down the left-wing. Tim Clarke then made a fine one-handed stop from Carter on 22 minutes after initially seeming to dive the wrong way. Tony Capaldi did beat Clarke in the 39th minute with Carter rolling the ball into the empty net but the effort was disallowed for offside.</p>
  <p>After the break, Phil Trainer produced Halesowen's first real shot on target but his 25-yard strike was collected at the second attempt by goalkeeper Scott Flinders. Richard Colwell then struck the side-netting from a 56th minute long ball from Les Hines. The Yeltz equalised in the 66th minute when TRAINER's cross from the left deceived Flinders to drift into the top corner of the net. With Halesowen briefly on top, John Newall touched a Karl Brennan corner onto the underside of the crossbar, with the rebound being fired high.</p>
  <p>The Premiership side wrapped up the tie with two late goals. Tony CAPALDI clinically finished off a 79th minute cross from substitute James Beauchamp from 12 yards out. The third goal arrived a minute from time with Barrowman put through on the break and he drew out Clarke before crossing for substitute Dean CURTIS to tap home.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Moor Green 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We are in big trouble now. A very disappointing loss to local rivals and sort of bogey team Moor Green means we're now 4 points from safety and struggling once again. More details in the  match reports .</p>
  <p>With our next league game against top of the table  <a href="http://www.thelambs.co.uk/">Tamworth</a>  it's difficult to see us getting anything there, but first we've got Birmingham at The Grove on Monday night in the Birmingham Senior Cup.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Hines, Skidmore, L. Collins, Stone, Spencer, Ashby, Leadbeater (May 63), Master, R. Collins (Brennan 63). Unused Subs: Newall, Charlton, Trainer</p>
  <p>Moor Green: Rachel; Hughes, Evans, Robinson, Sanders, Scheppel (Woodley 80), Stanley, Peer, Elmes, Martin, Petty (Myers 81). Unused Subs: Faulds, Blake, Walker.</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Lever (Leicester) Attendance: 598 Booked: L. Collins (12), Stone (83) Sponsors' Man of the Match : Les Hines</p>
  <p>Halesowen increased their relegation worries by falling to their third defeat of the season at the hands of near-neighbour bogey-side Moor Green.</p>
  <p>A generally poor game saw little goal-mouth incident and the Yeltz have now failed to score in 8 of their 12 home league games.</p>
  <p>Kirk Master surged forward in the first minute and played the ball out left for Jason Ashby to cross but the Moors defence cleared as Stuart Skidmore advanced on goal. Andy Spencer then made a persistent run at the visiting defence four minutes later.</p>
  <p>Richard Evans, on-loan from Birmingham City, saw his 25-yard shot drift just over the Halesowen bar in the 7th minute and on 17 minutes Gavin Stone needlessly headed behind goal to give Moor Green a corner.</p>
  <p>With the game desperately needing a goal, Richard Colwell turned in his own half and sent a long cross forward in the 26th minute that was headed on by Richard Leadbeater. A minute later Skidmore drove well wide on the sanded surface from 25-yards out. In the 33rd minute Les Hines swung over a left wing cross and goalkeeper Adam Rachel did well to punch a high ball clear after Ross Collins connected. At the other end, Jai Stanley hit weakly at Tim Clarke from 20-yards in the 38th minute. Good work from Ashby then led to Master winning a 50th minute corner and the ball fell for Andy Spencer to lash over the bar from the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>The Moors enjoyed a good spell at the start of the second period and were unlucky in the 53rd minute when former-Yeltz striker Rob Elmes hit a 20-yard drive that cannoned off the underside of the bar with Ross Collins tidying up. Three minutes later the visitors snatched the winning goal when Stanley played an incisive pass for Jae MARTIN to swivel and shrug off two defenders before planting the ball into the bottom of the net beyond Clarke from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>Master's tame strike was easily collected by Rachel in the 70th minute before Halesowen's best chance arrived two minutes later when a Hines cross fell invitingly for Spencer in a crowded area but he placed his shot against the legs of goalkeeper Rachel. A 74th minute Colwell shot was then blocked by Elmes and deflected for a corner.</p>
  <p>Moor Green were awarded an 83rd minute penalty when Gavin Stone brought down Martin as he burst forward into the box but Clarke made an excellent diving save to his left to keep out Stanley's spot-kick.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were unable to find an equaliser and two minutes from full-time substitute Karl Brennan met a Hines cross but hit high over the bar.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 6 Swindon Supermarine 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty yeltz kicked off the second half of their league campaign with an emphatic 6-0 victory over Swindon Supermarine. With both Redditch and Rugby losing, we've made up some important ground at the top of the  table .</p>
  <p>Jason started things off with two first half goals - his first for eight games - before second half goals from Spencer, Steane, Frazer McHugh (back whilst looking for another club) and Baker turned it into something of a rout.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday Evesham are the visitors to The Grove. They're on a pretty decent run at the moment including beating Redditch, but it's important we continue our run of victories.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Charlton (Small 66), Grocutt (Smith 64), Jones, Baker (Skidmore 70), Hollis, Ashby, Spencer, McHugh, Steane. Unused Subs: Lowry, Vaughan</p>
  <p>Swindon Supermarine: King; Toomey, Futcher, Bennett, McCluskey (Grainge 62), Copp, Edwards, Terry, Carter (Gee 76), Miller, Matthews (Blastland 62). Unused Subs: Slattery, Gill</p>
  <p>Referee: P. Martin (Wellingborough) Attendance: 436 Booked: Carter (71) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Simon Hollis</p>
  <p>Halesowen smashed Swindon for six of the best with ex-Bradford City midfielder Fraser McHugh running the show from midfield in a devastating display of quality finishing.</p>
  <p>In a lively opening Jason Ashby picked up a poor clearance from Swindon goalkeeper Tom King in the 4th minute but turned to fire just wide. Justin Miller headed across the Halesowen goal in the 10th minute but it was McHugh who set up Andy Spencer to strike a ten yard shot off the Swindon crossbar in the 10th minute. Home goalkeeper Mark Sheils then made a good save from Justin Miller and Jimmy Carter in the 25th minute after the Swindon forwards picked up a loose ball.</p>
  <p>League-leading marksman Ashby then set Halesowen on their way with two goals within ninety seconds. On 28 minutes ASHBY latched onto a poor defensive header to beat King with a cheeky chip from 18-yards. McHugh then played a splendid ball through to Ben Steane and he crossed for ASHBY to head home a second goal from five yards in the 30th minute. Five minutes before half-time Sheils protected Halesowen's lead by gathering a 25-yard free-kick from Simon Futcher.</p>
  <p>STEANE added a third goal to remember for the Yeltz in the 51st minute when he won the ball in midfield and unleashed a magnificent powerful, dipping shot into the top corner of the net from 35-yards to the gasping delight of the home crowd. With the home side running riot, the unmarked McHUGH made it 4-0 a minute later by cracking home into the bottom corner from 10-yards. The rampant Yeltz made it three goals in three minutes in a superb 54th minute break with Simon Hollis playing the ball out to Ashby and SPENCER raced into the area to convert the cross from close range.</p>
  <p>In continuing waves of attacks, King blocked a Spencer shot in the 55th minute and Lewis Baker headed Asa Charlton's corner onto the roof of the net four minutes later. BAKER increased the misery of ex-Chippenham manager Tommy Saunders in his first game in charge of Swindon by rifling home a sixth home goal in the 63rd minute when unmarked in the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Spencer's shot was turned around the post in the 65th minute but the game finally calmed down after a series of late substitutions. King gathered a 20-yard drive from Hollis in the 74th minute and in the final minute Sheils tipped a cross-shot from Futcher over the bar. Seconds later Ashby almost added a seventh goal but headed Steane's cross wide in front of goal, although enough had already been done to erase the painful memory of the four-goal defeat at Swindon earlier in the season.</p>

    <h3>FAT  Alfreton 2 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz crashed out of the FA Trophy 2-1 to Unibond Division One team  <a href="http://www.alfretontownfc.com/">Alfreton Town</a> .</p>
  <p>They'd worked wonders to get the game on, but the pitch was heavy and uneven and it was quite foggy too. We maybe had the better of a poor first-half without threatening them at all, but as the game went on they had more and more pressure before they took the lead after the break.</p>
  <p>It was hard to see how we'd get back into it but a mistake from their keeper led to  <b>Rosco scrambling it home</b>  and it was all to play for. We hit the post just after, but then we seemed to sit back and eventually their pressure told with a late winner.</p>
  <p>Despite their impressive form they weren't particularly good, but they were obviously more confident than us and they deserved their victory.</p>
  <p>On Saturday Moor Green come to The Grove in a league game that we really need three points from. Come on!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Alfreton Town: Turner; Bradshaw, Jules, Hobson, Heath, Knapper, France, Johnson, Circuit, Robshaw (Dolby 70), Bettney. Unused Subs: Brookes, Hindley, Highfield, Ford</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Hines, Newall, L. Collins, Stone, Smith (Brennan 68), Ashby, Leadbeater, Spencer (Shanahan 80), R. Collins. Unused Subs: Master, Trainer, Adamson</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Haywood (Wakefield) Attendance: 681 Booked: None</p>
  <p>The promising Trophy run ended in disappointing fashion with the Yeltz being outplayed in the North Derbyshire mud. The game only went ahead with intensive morning pitch work - including the use of industrial heaters - but it was the Yeltz who blew hot and cold during a game in which they conceded too much play in midfield.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were first to show with Richard Colwell clipping a shot straight at goalkeeper Ross Turner after a poor 1st minute clearance by Lee Hobson. Ross Collins then blasted wide from Andy Spencer's 5th minute cross.</p>
  <p>However, the runaway leaders of the Unibond Division One had already clocked up an unbeaten sequence of 23 games and clearly fancied their chances against their higher league opposition as they took charge of the game. Jamie Robshaw worked down the right to earn a 17th minute corner taken by Chris Bettney with ex-Sheffield United star Carl Bradshaw seeing his shot cleared off the line. Alfreton's fourth corner in the 21st minute was lost by Tim Clarke in a crowded goal-mouth, but Hobson smashed the loose ball way over the bar and into the adjacent gardens. Ryan France then struck the base of the post in the 33rd minute and when the ball was crossed back into the area Bradshaw nodded inches wide. Three minutes before half-time Halesowen ventured up-field with Jason Ashby's cross from the left deflected for a corner, but Ross Collins saw his shot blocked by a packed defence.</p>
  <p>The travelling faithful had the luxurious choice of 600 seats behind the goal for the second half - but as no-one had thought to build a stand first, the seating was open to the elements.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued on the defensive in the second period and had a 53rd minute let-off when Clarke was beaten to the ball by Robshaw but the striker's shot took an eternity to roll agonisingly wide of the post against the slope. The home side then forced a series of corners with Halesowen struggling to clear and took the lead in the 58th minute with HOBSON heading a cross from Bettney past the diving Clarke from 10 yards. Spurred on by the goal, the home side poured forward with Steve Johnson touching just wide on the hour.</p>
  <p>A 66th minute shot from Ross Collins flashed across the Alfreton goal before Halesowen equalised three minutes later against the run of play. A free-kick from Les Hines was headed on by Gavin Stone and when Turner failed to gather the ball the last defender cleared off the line but the ball struck ROSS COLLINS before hitting the back of the net. With Halesowen on the up at last, Andy Spencer struck the post in the 79th minute.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen were denied a replay two minutes from time when JOHNSON had all the time in the world to turn and smash beyond Clarke from 10 yards after Hobson headed on a Steve Circuit cross.</p>

  <p>I'm feeling very deprived at the moment, with our third game on the trot being called off because of the bad weather. Very frustrating for everyone.</p>
  <p>On Saturday - weather permitting of course - we've got a very interesting FA Trophy 3rd Round tie away to Unibond Division One side  <a href="http://www.alfretontownfc.com/">Alfreton Town</a>  next Saturday.</p>
  <p>They're well clear at the top of their league, have scored loads of goals and beat Stafford Rangers in the last round so it's going to be a difficult tie. However, another form line shows they only beat Spennymoor 2-1 and are in a weaker league than ourselves, so it should be a very good game.</p>

  <p>After some very wet weather, it wasn't much surprise when the game against Newport was called off because of a waterlogged pitch. This hasn't affected our position in the table at all as only one game managed to escape the bad weather.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us - weather permitting - all the way to  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/doverbhoy/">Dover</a>  in what could be a difficult game, although we gave them a good match at The Grove earlier in the season.

  <p>The mighty Yeltz finished off the year with a much needed 2-1 victory against Hastings. A first half goal from Jason and a winner from Big Rich means we go into 2003  just above the relegation zone  in in very tight bottom half of the table.</p>
