    <h3></h3>

    <p>
  <p>I expect you've been a bit distracted by the World Cup like me, but there's been a few bits of news of the Mighty Yeltz.</p>
  <p>On the transfer front, we've signed old favourite  <b>Rob Elmes</b> , and also his ex-Hereford teammate  <b>Jimmy Quiggin</b>  and attacking midfielder. A couple of good additions to the squad I would say. We won't be getting back ther other old boys Snapper and Piearce as they've signed for Worcester and Hednesford respectively. We're also looking to sign former Wolves reserve striker  <b>Richard Leadbetter</b>  if he can prove his fitness.</p>
  <p>The voting for the  <a href="/haveyoursay/halloffame/"&gt;Yeltz Hall of Fame</a>  has now closed, so you can see who's made it into the list of all time greats.</p>
  <p>The full list of friendlies (I think!) is now available on the  <a href="/anorak/results.asp?season=2002"&gt;fixtures page</a> , with the first game on July 16th at the Harriers. Also, Mr. Cooper has produced a lovely  <a href="/posters/July2002.pdf"&gt;poster</a>  for you to download, print out and put in your window to get all those waverers to get down The Grove this season. Come on!</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Bedworth 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's been a nice little holiday, and of course it's been great to win the league, but next season we'll be back where we should never have left - in the Premier Division.</p>
  <p>Congratulations to Brendan, the players and everyone else who've turned the club around after the disastrous Chambers/Moore era and given us all hope again. Next year could be very important if the planned reorganisation of the 3 feeder leagues into 2 goes ahead, but with Brendan in charge I'm very confident in the future.</p>
  <p>Today's game was a bit of a let down after last week's excitement with the mighty Yeltz losing 1-0 to Bedworth but it doesn't matter one bit. Neil Smith deservedly won player of the season, with Mark Taylor second and Tim Clarke and Lee Collins equal third.</p>
  <p>Other results saw King's Lynn and Newport IOW (unfortunately) relegated along with Merthyr and Salisbury, and Grantham joining Hastings in being promoted from the Eastern Division. Also, Kettering overtook Tamworth to clinch promotion to the Conference.</p>
  <p>As usual, the site will continue to bring you any news throughout the summer, and if I have time I'm also looking to overhaul the site. As ever, if you've got any suggestions  <a href="mailto:poll@yeltzland.net"&gt;mail me</a> . Enjoy the World Cup and I'll see you all next season. Oh, and don't forget the  <a href="/haveyoursay/halloffame/"&gt;Hall of Fame</a>  vote.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith (Cowley 76), L. Collins, Newall, Spencer, Jones (R. Collins 59), May (G. Smith 59), Taylor, Hines</p>
  <p>Bedworth United: Williams; Oddy, Lloyd (Sewell 45), Sanders, Richardson, Parsons, Steane, Gibson, Aston (Drewitt 59), Partridge (Morson 80), Whitmore</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Sarginson (Rugeley) Attendance: 731 Sponsors' Man of the Match: Mark Taylor</p>
  <p>Halesowen were presented with the Dr Martens Western Championship Shield by Janet Lloyd (the daughter of Harry Rudge) in front of the Harry Rudge Stand at the end of their final game of the season. Prior to the game Neil Smith was selected as the Supporters' Player of the Season with Mark Taylor gaining second place and Lee Collins sharing third spot with Tim Clarke.</p>
  <p>On the pitch itself, the game was tailor-made for that well-worn phrase "a typical end-of-season affair" with Halesowen showing little of the form that brought Premier football back to the Grove in a tremendous season. Bedworth's winning goal came out of the blue in the 15th minute when the ball broke kindly for Richard Gibson to despatch a 20-yard drive beyond Tim Clarke. For all their possession Halesowen created few clear-cut chances and found the bone dry surface broke up their usual fluent style. Andy Spencer crossed in the 21st minute but Leroy May scooped the ball over the bar and on the half-hour Richard Colwell crossed for Andy Jones to blast over from 10-yards out. Two minutes later Jones shot weakly at Richard Williams after Mark Taylor had waltzed through the Bedworth back-line. Just before the break the Yeltz won a series of corners from Les Hines and Mark Taylor but Lee Collins hit his volley way over the bar from 10 yards out.</p>
  <p>At the start of the second half Hines blasted a 15-yard free-kick just past the post as the newly crowned Champions tried to fight back. A 56th minute clearance fell kindly for Jones but another chance went begging when he volleyed wide in front of an open goal. Jason Burnham then drilled just wide before a rare Bedworth attack saw Chris Partridge bringing a save out of Tim Clarke. On the hour Burnham's shot took a deflection but Richard Williams just tipped the ball away from the foot of the post. Six minutes later a long throw-in from Burnham was headed into the arms of Williams by Andy Spencer. A minute from time Bedworth almost increased their lead in a rare break but substitute Andy Morson shot straight at Clarke as the uneventful game drew to a close.</p>
  <p>Despite the disappointing game, the mood swiftly changed to thoughts of the Championship with jubilant Yeltz fans relishing the prospect of a swift return to the Premier Division. The presentation of the Manager of the Month award for March to Brendan Phillips was followed by Lee Collins collecting the Championship Shield with "We are the Champions" ringing out around the Grove.</p>

    <h3>Mangotsfield 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Just brilliant! The mighty Yeltz clinched the Western Division title in style with a brilliant comeback against an excellent Mangotsfield side.</p>
  <p>The first half was pretty even and uneventful, but then the Yeltz faithful were shocked when  <b>Mangotsfield took probably a deserved lead</b>  10 minutes after the break. However, we should have known not to worry (easy to write that now).  <b>Mark Taylor</b>  broke through their defence, rounded the keeper and took what seemed ages to calmly slot in the equaliser. Then a fantastic goal to win it - Les Hines hit a perfect 50 yard pass over the top for  <b>Andy Jones</b>  to control and fire home the winner. The massed ranks of fans wearing their Brendan Phillips' T-shirts celebrated in style and everyone was very, very happy. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Congratulations to Brendan and the team for making us very very happy in what's been a brilliant season for everyone. Roll on next season.</p>
  <p>There's strong rumours that we've come to some agreement with Halesowen Harriers about them being some sort of feeder club for us - more if and when I hear. Also don't forget the  <b> Yeltz Hall of Fame </b>  - your chance to recognise players, managers or indeed anyone who has made an outstanding contribution to Halesowen Town.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings Bedworth to The Grove for the last game of the season when the Championship Shield (I think that's what it is) will be presented.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Mangotsfield Utd: R. Clarke; Hedges (Pendry 75), Hallett, Barlass, Hendy (Crowley 69), Loydon, Claridge, Summers, Edwards, Seal, Brooks. Sub: Penny</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Newall, Cowley (Spencer 62 (R. Collins 87)), Jones, May (Bailey 29), Taylor, Hines</p>
  <p>Referee: T. Curtis (Bath) Attendance: 403 Booked: Taylor (26), L. Collins (40), Brooks (90).</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally secured the league title in style but were made to fight back from a goal behind against a strong in-form Mangotsfield. The victory extended Halesowen's unbeaten league run to 18 games and wrecked Mangotsfield's own stretch of 11 games without defeat.</p>
  <p>The first half developed into a tough midfield battle with few chances although Mark Summers drilled just wide for Mangotsfield after two minutes and Andy Jones glanced a free header wide of the mark from Jason Burnham's 9th minute cross. Mark Taylor then played the ball down the centre of the field after 21 minutes but goalkeeper Rob Clarke raced off his line to beat Alex Cowley to the ball. Cowley then went on to clip a Burnham throw-in just over the bar a minute later. The visitors won their first corner on the half-hour when a shot from Les Hines was blocked and from the corner kick the hosts eventually cleared efforts from Hines and John Newall. A minute before the break Tim Clarke saved a volley from Nick Brooks after incisive approach play from the home side.</p>
  <p>The game sprung to life in an exciting second period with the Yeltz forcing three early corners with Rob Clarke producing a splendid reflex save from a Lee Collins header. Hines then raced down the right wing and pulled the ball back but Dennis Bailey hit wide of the mark. Mangotsfield took a 55th minute lead when a long ball from Darren Edwards found David Seal free on the left and he played a delightful ball across goal for Rob Claridge to convert. The goal inspired the league leaders with Newall volleying wide after 57 minutes but it was the introduction of the threatening Andy Spencer that caused the real damage to Mangotsfield.</p>
  <p>Mark Taylor equalised on 65 minutes when he charged down a clearance from Lee Barlass and took the ball on to beat the last man and round goalkeeper Rob Clarke before calmly hitting home. Mangotsfield beat the Halesowen defence again with neat approach play in the 71st minute but Claridge smashed the ball against the post allowing Richard Colwell to hack the ball clear of danger. The visitors notched the winner after 83 minutes when Andy Jones took down a long ball from Hines and prodded past Rob Clarke. In a frantic finish Seal smashed an 88th minute goalbound free-kick from 25 yards but Tim Clarke flew through the air to turn the ball for a corner. Bailey then volleyed inches wide from a Colwell cross as Halesowen played the possession game. Clarke made another tremendous save to protect the lead in the 89th minute when Seal met a cross with a low header but Clarke raced across goal to gather the ball into his midriff.</p>
  <p>After 8 minutes of stoppage time the final whistle set the champagne corks popping and signalled the start of partying on the terraces. The trophy will be presented after the final game of the season against Bedworth at the Grove next Saturday 27th April.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Gloucester 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We're still waiting to be mathematically certain of going up as Champions after a second successive draw at home to Gloucester. It would have been nice to clinch it at The Grove, but we now  <b>only need a point</b>  from the last two games assuming Chippenham win their last game. Chippenham themselves have now confirmed promotion, and beat Cirencester 3-1 on Thursday.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us to  <b>Mangotsfield for the last away game of the season</b>  and the usual fancy dress shenanigans. It should be an excellent day out to try and finish this successful season off in style.</p>
  <p>There's a new section of the site that I'm very excited about - the  <b> Yeltz Hall of Fame </b> . It's your chance to recognise players, managers or indeed anyone who has made an outstanding contribution to Halesowen Town. Please check it out.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Davies; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Cowley (Bailey), Spencer (G. Smith), Jones, May, Taylor, Hines. Sub: R. Collins</p>
  <p>Gloucester City: Bath; Steadman, Marshall (Webb), Griffiths, Wilkinson, McCluskey, Burns, Jenkins, Thompson (L. Smith), Hoskins, Prince. Sub: Howard</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Ainge (Walsall) Attendance: 777 Sponsors' Man of the Match: Lee Collins</p>
  <p>Halesowen kept their expectant fans waiting to clinch the title after being held to a goal-less draw by gallant Gloucester City. With Chippenham winning at Atherstone, the game left the Yeltz still requiring a further point to be mathematically certain of being crowned as champions.</p>
  <p>Ball control was difficult on a rock-hard surface and shots flew high over the bar all afternoon in a game dominated by the Yeltz with Gloucester hardly mustering a shot on target all afternoon. Alex Cowley turned and fired wide after four minutes and Andy Spencer hit the cross-bar four minutes later when Leroy May headed on a long throw-in from Jason Burnham. Spencer crashed the ball high again in the 33rd minute and just before half-time Cowley delivered dangerously from the right for visiting defender Neil Griffiths to nudge the ball past his own post for a corner.</p>
  <p>Gloucester's best opportunity came in the 50th minute when young on-loan goalkeeper Clint Davies mis-kicked a clearance straight to Luke Prince but central defender Lee Collins made a great saving tackle in front of an empty net. Les Hines and Cowley fired further shots well over the bar before the Tigers' goalkeeper Matt Bath made a fine blocking save from a May header after 80 minutes with Andy Jones and Gary Smith ready to pounce. With growing frustration, Halesowen mounted a final frantic assault on the Gloucester goal but could not break the deadlock to collect the Western Division trophy.</p>

    <h3>Cinderford 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz will have to wait a little longer to clinch the league title after only managing a 0-0 draw at Cinderford. It's a little disappointing but we still only need a couple of points to be mathematically sure, and it would be nice to get those at The Grove - hopefully against Gloucester next Saturday.</p>
  <p>I really hope next Saturday will be a happy occasion, and let's extend a warm welcome to all the visiting Gloucester fans. If anyone's thinking of coming just to start trouble, please don't bother - we really don't want anything like that happening at all.</p>
  <p>Chippenham have achieved a sufficient ground grading for the Premier Division, and look almost certain to finish second after winning 4-0 while both Solihull and Weston could both only draw.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Cinderford Town: Fisher; Bale, Hopkins, Tomkins, Hall, Callinan, Truman, Ince, Hook, Addis, Harris. Subs: Weyman, Donovan, Pitcairn</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Davies; Colwell, Burnham, R. Collins, L. Collins, Cowley, Bailey (G. Smith 66), Jones, May, Taylor (Brennan 83), Hines. Sub: Phillips</p>
  <p>Referee:  S. Humphrey (Swindon) Attendance: 363 Booked: Hall (81)</p>
  <p>The Championship champagne remained on ice as Halesowen did everything but score and had to settle for a goal-less draw against a defiant Cinderford. Already promoted Halesowen were prevented from notching an elusive goal to tie up the title and now hope to confirm their Championship at home to Gloucester City next Saturday 13th April, (kick off 3pm).</p>
  <p>The Yeltz were forced to make several changes with five first team players unavailable, but still completely dominated the game with Brendan Phillips electing to play an adventurous 4-3-3 formation and included son Kelvin on the substitute's bench. Young 19-year old Australian goalkeeper Clint Davies made his debut and enjoyed an easy afternoon as Cinderford hardly mustered a shot on target all afternoon.</p>
  <p>Simon Truman saw a 4th minute free-kick drift across goal for Cinderford but as Halesowen went on the offensive Dennis Bailey nodded a Leroy May cross just wide after 6 minutes. Halesowen then forced three successive corners from Les Hines in the 13th minute in which May had a shot blocked off the line. May and Andy Jones bore down on goal from a sweet Mark Taylor pass in the 17th minute, but Jones shot weakly at goalkeeper Andy Fisher. Hines then hit just wide when May laid off a cross from Richard Colwell in the 23rd minute. In continued Halesowen pressure, Alex Cowley did well on the right but Jones lofted the ball high over the bar in the 28th minute. Just before half-time, Bailey headed a 44th minute Jason Burnham cross just over and then screwed a shot wide when put through by Hines.</p>
  <p>Cindeford had beaten the Yeltz at the Grove earlier in the season but never looked able to complete an unlikely double, but they now join Chippenham as the only teams to take four points from the Yeltz over two games.</p>
  <p>Halesowen took up residence in the Cinderford half after the break but still couldn't break the deadlock. Richard Colwell, searching for his first goal of the season, hit a 20-yard shot at Fisher after 47minutes and Ross Collins sliced a good chance well wide on 65 minutes after being set-up by Mark Taylor. Alex Cowley went on a surging 68th minute run but was finally crowded out near goal by the home defence. A dangerous 87th minute Hines free-kick rebounded to Gary Smith who screwed wide and, although May managed to reach the shot with his head, the chance fell just wide. In the final minute Andy Jones met a left wing cross from Hines and turned but saw his shot blocked into the side-netting. Jones then glanced a header inches wide from Colwell's cross in the final chance of the sunny but bracing Gloucestershire afternoon.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 4 Solihull 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The once again mighty  <b>Yeltz clinched promotion</b>  on a fantastic night at The Grove by beating Solihull 4-1 with a stunning second-half performance.</p>
  <p>We were lucky to be at 1-1 at half-time - we'd took an early lead through  <b>Andy Spencer</b>  but they had most of the play and fully deserved their equaliser. However after the break we were inspired and goals from  <b>Spencer</b>  again,  <b>Skidder</b>  and  <b>Leroy</b>  put the large (856) and vocal crowd into a party mood. As ever,  DJ's match report  summarises the details better than I can.</p>
  <p> <b>Congratulations to Brendan, all the players and other staff</b>  on taking us back up to the Premier Division at the first attempt. We've really turned things around after the nightmare of last season and let's hope we can build on this next year.</p>
  <p>There's still the  <b>title</b>  to win, and we can clinch that by  <b>winning at Cinderford on Saturday</b>  as we only need three more points assuming Chippenham win their four remaining games.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins (Newall 45), Skidmore, Spencer (G. Smith 87), Jones, May (Bailey 74), R. Collins, Cowley</p>
  <p>Solihull Borough: Murphy; Saunders, Hamilton, M. Smith (Hayde 76), Knight, Cooper, Hollis, C. Smith, Hall, Amos, J. Smith (Lovelock 64). Sub: Dutton</p>
  <p>Referee: P. Keane (Bilston) Attendance: 856 Booked: Amos (12), Skidmore (47), Hayde (88), Jones (89) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Richard Colwell</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town booked their promotion place back into the Premier division with an emphatic win over third-placed Solihull and now require just three points to claim the Championship title.</p>
  <p>Solihull's Ian Cooper crossed in the first minute for Derek Hall to hit an overhead kick over the bar before the Yeltz took a 14th minute lead with Andy SPENCER beating Solihull goalkeeper Brendan Murphy who was slow off his line to a long ball. A strangely disjointed first-half performance saw Halesowen desperately missing the play-making skills of Les Hines and Mark Taylor with Solihull gradually gaining the upper hand as the half wore on. Jason Smith shot straight at Tim Clarke in the 17th minute and Clarke then dived to save from Cooper three minutes later. Without dead-ball experts Hines or Taylor, a handily placed free-kick on the edge of the box was blasted over the bar by Spencer on 23 minutes. A slip by Ross Collins let in Chris Smith to shoot just wide after 37 minutes but Solihull deservedly equalised when Jason Smith played the ball for Derek HALL to chest down and volley into the bottom corner after 42 minutes.</p>
  <p>A much-needed reshuffle saw the introduction of John Newall but few could have predicted the second-half that unfolded with Halesowen transformed by the half-time team-talk to re-assert their league-leading authority with three goals in a thrusting 20-minute spell.</p>
  <p>Man of the Match Richard Colwell worked hard to win two 53rd minute corners before the Yeltz restored their lead in the 56th minute with SPENCER hitting home his second goal from a 25-yard shot helped by a deflection off Cooper after a Jason Burnham corner was only half-cleared. Just three minutes later Spencer broke free on the left and passed across goal for Stuart SKIDMORE to crash home into the top right hand corner of the net from 15 yards. Newall missed a great chance in front of goal on the hour but with Halesowen on fire, a defence-splitting cross field pass from Andy Jones set up Leroy MAY to slot home his 18th goal of the season in the 71st minute and start Halesowen's promotion party-time. Gary Knight cleared an Andy Jones effort off the line in the 78th minute to prevent further goals but with Halesowen's fans in full voice, the relegation trauma on Easter Bank Holiday Monday exactly a year ago was long forgotten.</p>

    <h3>Bilston 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <root>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz are  <b>just one win away from returning to the Premier Division</b>  after a hard fought and slightly nervous win at Bilston.</p>
  <p>We started well against a Bilston side who at least tried to play a passing game on a dry and bumpy pitch. Their keeper looked about 5 foot tall so we weren't too surprised when  <b>Leroy</b>  jumped above him to head in the first. We missed a few good chances in the rest of the first half, though  <b>Mark Taylor</b>  scored his first for The Yeltz from the edge of box and it looked all over.</p>
  <p>However in the second half Bilston continued to try and play, and understandably we were happy to settle with what we'd got. When they scored half way through the second half everyone got very nervous, and despite Bilston having a man sent off for a bad tackle on Les (who later hobbled off), we were very relieved when the final whistle went.</p>
  <p>So on to Monday, and  <b>a huge game at home to Solihull Borough</b>  (kickoff 7.45pm). The permutations are this:</p>
  <p>We think the other games are afternoon kickoffs, so we should know what we need to do by the time we play. Whatever the outcome,  <b>get all your mates down The Grove and let's make Monday a night to remember</b> . Even I'm going to be there, but I'll try and update at least part of the site as soon as I can (look for the Stop Press on thetop right of the home page)</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 Evesham 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A first half  <b>hat-trick</b>  from top scorer  <b>Leroy May</b>  too the mighty Yeltz very close to promotion with an easy 3-0 victory at home to Evesham. Equally as important was  <b>Solihull beating Weston</b>  1-0, which now means we only need  <b>5 more points to gain promotion</b> . Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Obviously  <b>we can now seal it by beating Bilston away on Saturday and then beating Solihull at The Grove on Monday</b> . I think that would be a nice way to clinch it. I'm going to be at both games for a change so the site might not be updated as quickly as usual.</p>

  <p>P.S. I think we've established the idiot Weston fan on  YeltzTalk  was being deliberately provocative, so we can close that particular topic now.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, Newall, Skidmore, Spencer, Jones (G. Smith 41), May, Taylor, Hines. Subs: Cowley, R. Collins</p>
  <p>Evesham United: Steadman; A. Smith, Parmenter (Maybury 58), Duff, Powell, Lutz, Mullen (Pountney 69), Webb, Pratt, Brown, Preedy. Sub: Davies</p>
  <p>Referee: A. McIlravey (Redditch) Attendance: 503 Booked: Mullen (25)</p>
  <p>Sponsors' Man of the Match: Neil Smith</p>
  <p>Experienced campaigner Leroy May hit a first-half hat-trick to put championship chasing Halesowen within five points and mathematical touching distance of the promotion finishing line.</p>
  <p>As early as the 2nd minute Evesham goalkeeper Darren Steadman made a point blank save from Andy Jones but the striker was ruled offside. In early exchanges a 5th minute cross from Mark Taylor then beat Evesham but no Yeltz forward was on hand to benefit and as the ball broke downfield Taylor raced back to clear for a corner at the other end. With Taylor in the thick of the action he touched a free-kick for Jason Burnham to hit a 20-yard shot that Steadman tipped over the bar for a 9th minute corner.</p>
  <p>
    Evesham missed their best chance of the game in the 19th minute when Paul Webb lofted a quality ball behind the Yeltz defence to find Shaun Pratt in space but Tim Clarke pulled off a tremendous diving save. The visitors paid the price for that miss in the 25th minute when Halesowen were awarded a free-kick for a reckless challenge by Scott Mullen on John Newall. Taylor's free-kick was hooked over by Neil Smith and Leroy May was on hand with a vital touch to nod home from two yards out. Three members of the Press Box, watching from an unfortunate angle and seeing the defender being congratulated, all believed the goal had gone in directly from Neil Smith, but confirmation from the dressing-room and from other angles of the ground confirmed it was a May goal.
    
      <i class="ed">(We'll let you off this time - ed)</i>
    
  </p>
  <p>Evesham continued to look lively up-front and found space in the Halesowen defence but were unable to capitalise and fell two goals behind in the 37th minute with Les Hines hitting an in-swinging corner which May swept into the roof of the net. May went on to complete his first-half hat-trick to put Halesowen three goals ahead a minute before the break. Andy Spencer worked his way behind the visiting defence and crossed for May to tap home with Evesham crying furiously for offside. Just on half-time Richard Colwell was on hand to clear off his goal-line from a James Brown effort.</p>
  <p>Phil Preedy blasted just wide for the visitors in the 46th minute who realised it wasn't their night when Scott Mullen's 52nd minute strike was disallowed by referee McIlravey. Halesowen went on to create several more chances but had already done enough to win the game in a fairly flat second half. May headed just wide from a Gary Smith cross in the 56th minute and Andy Spencer headed into the arms of Steadman after 68 minutes. For Evesham Pratt hit a 63rd minute drive from 20 yards over the bar but the visitors had Steadman to thank as he managed to grab the ball when Spencer hit towards goal in the 76th minute after the ball broke from Gary Smith's challenge on the Evesham 'keeper. Steadman went on to make a great save with his feet from Gary Smith and his defence kept the league leaders out in an injury time goalmouth scramble.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 6 RC Warwick 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Just 11 points needed for promotion now afteran emphatic 6-0 victory over struggling Racing Club Warwick at The Grove.  <b>A hat-trick from Andy Jones, two from Leroy</b>  an a late one from new bloke  <b>Alex Cowley</b>  maintained our long unbeaten run in the league. Chippenham's game was called off butSolihull and Weston both won, but if we keep winning it doesn't matter what anyone else does.</p>
  <p>There's been some 'interesting' feedback after the Weston game, including a very inflammatory message on  YeltzTalk  from someone who calls themselves a Weston fan. I'm not going to let the forum turn offensive - that's why I moderate it to get rid of the usual rubbish - but for once I thought everyone should see what was said. I wasn't at the game but I'm sure those of you who were there would like to comment. Abusive messages in return won't get on though.</p>
  <p>Anyhoo,  <b>Evesham</b>  visit The Grove on Tuesday, and on the same night Solihull play Weston in what is obviously a crucial game for both teams.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell (R. Collins 81), Burnham (Cowley 77), N. Smith, Newall, Skidmore, Spencer, Jones, May (G. Smith 87), Taylor, Hines</p>
  <p>Racing Club Warwick: Stephenson; McWilliam, Jackson, Ward, Marlow, Hodson, Haywood (Wiseman 58), Yates, Eden, Kinder (Green 66), Massingham (Gozzard 55)</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Dawes (Willenhall) Attendance: 527 Booked: Massingham (15)</p>
  <p>Sponsors' Man of the Match (Sylvia Heal JP, MP): Andy Jones</p>
  <p>Andy Jones hit a hat-trick amongst another flood of goals at The Grove to leave Warwick without a league victory for 18 games since October.</p>
  <p>With just five weeks of the season remaining, Halesowen remain well on course for a swift return back into the Premier Division and it took just four minutes for the league leaders to gain the upper hand. Neil Smith back-headed a Les Hines right wing cross for Leroy MAY to turn home from close range. May then skied the ball over the bar in the 8th minute and Jones headed weakly into the arms of goalkeeper Neil Stephenson as the Yeltz sought to improve their goal difference. For Warwick, David Jackson shot high over the bar and Mark Hodson rose to head just wide in the 21st minute. However, the Yeltz remained well on top and Warwick had an escape when Jones just failed to react to a Richard Colwell cross that bounced off Stephenson in the 33rd minute. A lightning break involving Andy Spencer, Mark Taylor and Hines resulted in Stuart Skidmore seeing his shot blocked in the 37th minute and a minute before the break Darren Massingham cleared a lob from Andy Spencer off the line to keep the half-time score respectable.</p>
  <p>Straight from the restart May pounced on a slip by Hodson and set up JONES to beat the veteran Warwick goalkeeper Stephenson from 10 yards out. Stephenson kept rampant Halesowen at bay by saving May's diving header in the 53rd minute with his legs before blocking another May shot after 62 minutes as Spencer waltzed through the Warwick rearguard. However, Stephenson was beaten again in the 64th minute when JONES turned in the box to plant a 15-yard shot into the net.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen making it look so easy MAY nodded home the fourth goal in the 72nd minute after Stephenson failed to grab Jason Burnham's cross. JONES completed a fine hat-trick five minutes later by side-footing into the net from 10 yards after good right-wing work by the impressive Andy Spencer. Following three late Halesowen substitutions the demoralised Warwick defence was caught out again in stoppage time with Alex COWLEY heading home a rebound from a Ross Collins shot.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Weston 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz gained a very important point against promotion rivals Weston, coming back from 2-0 down with two very late goals.</p>
  <p>I don't know what it was like at the game, but sitting at home waiting for SMS updates was unbearable. Ex-Yeltz star  <b>Frankie Bennett</b>  scored for Weston early on and crashed another against the bar before the break, and when he scored a second after the break it was looking like Chippenham all over again. However, this time we did manage to come back and goals from  <b>Andy Spencer</b>  and  <b>Neil Smith</b>  kept Weston well behind us in the promotion race.</p>
  <p>Chippenham beat Solihull 3-1 on Wednesday night, which means we still need just 14 points from the remaining 8 games to clinch promotion now, and let's hope we can get 3 of those against struggling  <b>Racing Club Warwick</b>  at The Grove on Saturday.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Skidmore, Spencer, Dennis Bailey (A. Jones 63), May, Taylor, Hines. Subs: Brennan, Newall</p>
  <p>Weston-Super-Mare: Bryant; Bennett, Tezel, Bird, Kilgour, Souter, Harris, Danny Bailey, Bevan (Mehew 63), Slater, Cox. Subs: Pritchard, White</p>
  <p>Referee: R. Green (Berkeley, Gloucs.) Attendance: 469 Sponsors' Man of the Match (The Jolly Boys -HTFC Supporters): Neil Smith</p>
  <p>Frankie Bennett returned to hit a brace for Weston and haunt his former club in a night of intense passion all around The Grove. However a dramatic late twist saw Halesowen earn a vital point by scoring two goals deep in time added on by the excellent referee Russell Green for the Seagulls time-wasting tactics. Prophetically, the match sponsors declared Neil Smith to be the man of the match minutes BEFORE he became the hero of the evening.</p>
  <p>It is reported that Weston manager had gone on local radio to describe both Chippenham and Halesowen as poor teams and with Weston attempting to make up ground there was clearly going to be much at stake. Andy Spencer was muscled off the ball in the penalty area in the 6th minute and at the other end Weston's ex-league star Stuart Slater had a deflected shot gathered by Tim Clarke. Halesowen continued to force the early pace but Weston rode their luck in their must-win game with a 15th minute header from Leroy May rebounding off the post into the arms of Mark Bryant on the goal-line from a Les Hines cross. Bryant then pounced on the ball after initially dropping a Hines free-kick but Frankie Bennett then showed his intentions at the other end by hitting the side-netting from a Weston corner after 18 minutes. Bryant came to Weston's rescue again to keep the league leaders at bay in the 22nd minute by producing a fingertip save from a Lee Collins header from a Mark Taylor cross.</p>
  <p>Weston took the lead in the 26th minute when Neil Smith's slip let in BENNETT to hammer into the roof of the net and it appeared to be Weston's night when Danny Bailey cleared another Collins header off the line a minute later. Hines curled a 35th minute free-kick wide but Bennett continued to trouble as he went on a run from midfield and thundered a 20-yard shot off the Halesowen crossbar just before the break.</p>
  <p>Halesowen forced three corners at the start of the second half with both Spencer and Stuart Skidmore seeing shots blocked. Despite the Halesowen pressure Weston's defence remained solid and they broke in the 73rd minute with substitute David Mehew putting BENNETT clear to crash home his second goal from 12 yards out in their first real attack of the half.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz have failed to beat any of the other three contenders for promotion and all seemed lost when May hit straight at goalkeeper Bryant a minute later. However, a 92nd minute cross from Mark Taylor was flicked on by May to find SPENCER in space to volley home from 8 yards. A last-ditch attempt saw Hines float a 94th minute free-kick into the centre of the box and a back-header from man-of-the match Neil SMITH on the penalty spot went through the arms of the despairing Bryant to level the score for jubilant Halesowen against their distraught visitors. There was hardly time for Weston to kick-off again as the buzz continued for several minutes around the ground from an exhilarating finish.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 5 Swindon Supermarine 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz continued their march back to the Premier Division with an easy 5-1 victory over bottom placed Swindon Supermarine. Two first half goals from Les Hines and one from Andy Spencer set us on our way, and further goals from Leroy and a JB penalty kept us on  top of the league  despite letting in a late Swindon penalty.</p>
  <p>In the other crucial promotion games, Chippenham drew 1-1 with Weston and Solihull won 4-0 against Gloucester. All this means is we now need a maximum of just 17 points to clinch promotion, and 19 points to become champions. I've added a handy reminder on the right of the home page to add to the excitement.</p>
  <p>Tuesday brings Weston to The Grove in a game which could just about clinch promotion for us. We still haven't won against any of the top teams this season so let's hope that changes and we can enjoy a comfortable end of season run in. Come on!</p>
  <p>As you can hopefully see I've tarted the site up a little - I hope you like it.</p>

  <p>Referee: S. Flannagan (Wednesfield) Attendance: 602 Booked: Dunton (48)</p>
  <p>Brendan Philips asked his players to remain totally focussed and received&#xD;
the perfect response in a game some observers felt could be a potential&#xD;
"banana skin". However, bottom side Swindon were sunk by a five-star&#xD;
performance with five goals in a 35-minute spell.</p>
  <p>Andy Spencer scuffed a 13th minute shot when Leroy May flicked on, but in a&#xD;
quiet opening Halesowen showed patience as relegation threatened Swindon&#xD;
packed their defence. The breakthrough came after 21 minutes when May was&#xD;
fouled on the edge of the penalty area and Les Hines fired a low free-kick&#xD;
directly past the wall and beyond goalkeeper Liam Bull. As Swindon's defence&#xD;
panicked Stuart Skidmore went close from a May flick on in the 23rd minute&#xD;
and the second goal soon followed three minutes later. In a crowded&#xD;
goalmouth Dennis Bailey saw his header cleared off the line from a corner&#xD;
but as Lee Collins turned the ball back in, Andy Spencer headed into the&#xD;
unprotected net from close range. On the half-hour Bailey had a shot turned&#xD;
away for a corner and then hit the side-netting from Mark Taylor's corner&#xD;
kick with the ball resembling a pin-ball in the Swindon area. Spencer&#xD;
crossed just high for May in the 36th minute and from the follow-up Bailey's&#xD;
shot was yet again blocked. Swindon earned their first corner of the game in&#xD;
the 44th minute but it was the Yeltz who went 3-0 ahead on the stroke of&#xD;
half-time when Swindon failed to clear a Skidmore cross and Hines had the&#xD;
easy task of heading into the unguarded net.</p>
  <p>The relentless pressure continued at the start of the second half with Mark&#xD;
Taylor skimming the bar in the 46th minute before the fourth goal arrived&#xD;
after 53 minutes. It was Supermarine's inability to defend against set&#xD;
pieces that was their undoing again when they failed to clear another corner&#xD;
from Hines and May was on hand to nod home from a couple of yards out. With&#xD;
Swindon all at sea, goalkeeper Bull pulled down Spencer as he was rounding&#xD;
him and about to shoot and Jason Burnham banged home the resulting penalty&#xD;
to increase the lead on 58 minutes. Tim Clarke was at last in action after&#xD;
80 minutes when he dived to save Dominic Dunton's 25 yard shot but Burnham&#xD;
then almost added to his tally but Bull just gathered the ball as he was&#xD;
being rounded.</p>
  <p>Swindon finally gained a goal when referee Flannagan awarded a penalty&#xD;
against Lee Collins who was retrieving a ball from Adam Giles that was&#xD;
trapped between his legs. Tom Jones showed it's not unusual for Swindon to&#xD;
score by firing home the penalty and sent Swindon back to the green, green&#xD;
grass of home with some consolation. In the final minute Swindon survived&#xD;
another goalmouth scramble from a corner with May cracking the crossbar.</p>

    <h3>WSC  Moor Green 3 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's a shame to go out of any cup, but we've got much more important things to concetrate on this year. A bit of a stuffing really by Moor Green which I suppose gives them a little revenge for our FA Cup victory earlier in the season.</p>
  <p>We've now got 10 league games left and 7 of those are at The Grove, so let's hope we can storm to the title with a string of victories. First up are bottom placed Swindon Supermarine on Saturday who have been slightly improved of late, but let's hope for another 3 points.</p>
  <p>Weston drew 2-2 last night against Evesham, which was nice. It's Chippenham v Weston on Saturday, so obviously at least one of them must drop some points too.</p>

  <p>A Les Hines freekick dropped awkwardly into the Moor Green area after 8&#xD;
minutes and just escaped the head of Neil Smith before bouncing out into&#xD;
safety for a goalkick. The Moors took a 10th minute lead after an&#xD;
uncharacteristic mistake by Lee Collins on the right let in Mark Crisp to&#xD;
cross for leading goalscorer Nathan Lamey to prod in his 27th goal of the&#xD;
season. Gary Smith almost equalised in the 13th minute on the break but&#xD;
after cleverly turning the last defender shot straight at the legs of&#xD;
goalkeeper Adam Rachel. Halesowen eventually tidied up some defensive&#xD;
confusion in the 35th minute after a slip by Lee Collins and a bad clearance&#xD;
kick from Tim Clarke.</p>
  <p>Seven minutes into the second half Andy Spencer headed a Hines cross just&#xD;
wide but Halesowen went 2-0 down in the 74th minute when a deep cross from&#xD;
Jae Martin was chested down and despatched from 12 yards past Clarke by the&#xD;
dangerous Lamey. Jason Burnham's 25 yard effort from a freekick was held by&#xD;
Rachel after 80 minutes and Clarke did well to pluck out a Martin shot two&#xD;
minutes later. Four minutes from time a left wing cross from Martin was&#xD;
volleyed home by substitute Danny Scheppel for Moor Green's third goal.</p>
  <p>News of a 2-2 home draw for Weston-SM brought some relief to the end of the&#xD;
evening - despite the earlier report from the Yeltz statistician who watched&#xD;
the game believing Weston had won 2-1! With Halesowen bowing out of their&#xD;
involvement in Cup football for the 2001-02 season, it's now time to&#xD;
concentrate fully on the final ten league games.</p>

    <h3>Bedworth 0 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After the bizarre experience of actually dropping some points last week, the mighty Yeltz earned another three points with a reasonably straightforward victory at mid-table Bedworth. Two goals from  <b>Leroy</b>  (although the first one was probably Les's) split by one from  <b>Andy Jones</b>  kept us on  top of the table  and well on course for both promotion and the title. All the other contenders also won, but we're another game closer to getting back up.</p>
  <p>There's been a bit of activity in the transfer market over the last few days. We've signed  <b>Alex Cowley</b> , a winger, on loan from Stourport until the end of the season, and  <b>Karl Brennan</b>  who's previously played for Hinckley, Nuneaton and Leicester City. This also means Matty Hall has been loaned out to Redditch.</p>
  <p>There's a new vote on the site you might find interesting - "Is the current team better than the Midland Division winning team of 89/90?"</p>
  <p>Tuesday takes us to Moor Green in the Worcester Senior semi-final replay, and then on Saturday the exotically named Swindon Supermarine visit The Grove on the back of a 6-2 victory over Shepshed!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bedworth Utd: Hateley; Oddy (Aston 76), Lloyd (Parsons 62), Sanders, Cooper, Crowley, McGregor, Goodman, Harrison, Partridge, Whitmore. Sub: Wilson</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, Smith, L. Collins, Skidmore, Spencer (Cowley 69), Bailey (Jones 62), May, Taylor, Hines. Sub: R. Collins</p>
  <p>Referee: G. Stretton (Enderby) Attendance: 303</p>
  <p>Halesowen enter the home straight with the luxury of seven home games from the remaining ten matches. But there is no complacency in the Halesowen camp as the league leaders recorded another convincing away victory in difficult windy conditions.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz almost went ahead within 30 seconds of the opening when Leroy May put Andy Spencer clear on goal but goalkeeper Gary Hateley made a last ditch clearance. Jason Burnham saw his 13th minute shot fly just over and Dennis Bailey then sent in a long range effort five minutes later. The Yeltz took a 25th minute lead when a right-wing corner from Les Hines curled into the net with the help of Leroy May after Hateley failed to gather the ball in the swirling wind. The goal has been credited to May with Leroy claiming a strike off his shoulder although it appeared the referee's assistant had already signalled a goal for Hines. In the 34th minute a Scott McGregor cross was flicked on for Bedworth but centre-forward Ross Harrison headed straight into the arms of Tim Clarke, who enjoyed a quiet afternoon's work.</p>
  <p>The second period started in quiet fashion although Spencer screwed wide after 49 minutes. Halesowen then went 2-0 ahead when a 63rd minute free-kick from Hines was met at the far post by Lee Collins and Andy Jones flashed home a header just one minute after his introduction as substitute.</p>
  <p>Bedworth should have pulled a goal back in the 73rd minute but Chris Partridge scooped the ball high in front of goal and two minutes from time Adam Cooper blasted high when well placed. On full-time May added Halesowen's third by powerfully heading home from close range following a flick-on from a Hines corner.</p>

    <h3>Solihull 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Although we've got used to winning our league games recently, the mighty Yeltz gained a very useful point away to one of their few promotion rivals. A first half goal from  <b>Leroy</b>  took us into the lead, but Solihull came back in the second half to get a draw in a match they really had to win.</p>
  <p>Chippenham had an easy victory against Warwick and Weston didn't have a game, so we're still  top of the table  and in an excellent position. Look out for the results of Weston at Cinderford and Solihull against Swindon on Tuesday.</p>
  <p>Our next game is on Saturday when we visit glamorous Bedworth in a game in which I'd hope we can get back to winning ways.</p>
</p>

  <p>Although Halesowen's impressive run of away wins finally ended, the point was important to prevent one of the possible promotion challengers from making any headway on Halesowen's top spot.</p>
  <p>In a slow Yeltz opening on a heavily sanded pitch, Mark Taylor was bundled over in the box after 9 minutes but referee Whitestone waved play on and Lee Collins then nodded a 16th minute free-kick from Les Hines just wide. Solihull's hot-shot striker Derek Hall turned in the penalty area a minute later but could only shoot weakly at Tim Clarke. After the cautious start, it was Solihull's Derek Hall who went close by blasting into the side-netting on 35 minutes from the left edge of the box.</p>
  <p>Halesowen enjoyed a fine spell of play in the ten minutes before half-time and should have taken the lead when Leroy May picked up a rebound and fed Mark Taylor who in turn set up Les Hines but he blasted wide from a good position. The lead finally arrived in the 39th minute when Denis Bailey forced a right wing corner. The corner kick fell to May two yards out with his back to goal and he cheekily back-heeled the ball into the net off the legs of Solihull's Craig Dutton. Jason Burnham's then saw a low shot saved by Brendan Murphy and at the other end Tim Clarke saved well from Andy Lovelock.</p>
  <p>Solihull deservedly equalised in the 63rd minute when a flowing move ended with Manual Pereira squaring for Chris Smith to fire into the bottom corner from 20 yards out with Clarke only able to watch. The league leaders survived a scare six minutes later when a dangerous right-wing cross found two forwards free in the box but Clarke made a fingertip save from Derek Hall's weak effort and the excellent Richard Colwell completed the clearance off the goal-line. Having lost Les Hines and Andy Spencer during the game through injury, the Yeltz appeared slightly heavy-legged as they came under a period of Solihull pressure.</p>
  <p>However, in and end-to-end finish of open play, substitute Matty Hall couldn't convert May's flick-on past Murphy, Andy Jones fired high when well placed in the 80th minute and a Lee Collins header fell just wide. For Solihull, Chris Smith shot high from the edge of the area after 85 minutes and Clarke produced a fine reflex save from a fierce 20-yard shot by Simon Hollis with two minutes remaining.</p>
  <p>A last minute corner for the Yeltz caused confusion for the Boro' defence but Lee Collins could only shoot into the arms of Murphy.</p>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz are still in the all important Worcester Senior Cup after a 1-1 draw against Moor Green at The Grove. An excellent strike from  <b>Andy Jones</b>  was cancelled out by a second half equaliser in a match played in difficult conditions. Replay details as soon as I hear.</p>
  <p>Elsewhere,  <b>Chippenham lost at home to Gresley</b> , Solihull stuffed Bilston 6-0 and Weston's game was called off. This has consolidated our lead at  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=23022002"&gt;the top of the table</a>  and gives both Solihull and Weston a chance of catching Chips and Ham if they win their games in hand.</p>
  <p>There's a few photos been sent in recently - thanks to DJ and Peter Blanchflower - that you might find of interest: action shots of the  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=16022002#photos"&gt;Evesham game</a>  and  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=23022002#photos"&gt;Brendan winning Manager of the Month</a> .</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us to  <b>Solihull</b>  in what's potentially our hardest game left. A victory for us would make it very difficult for Solihull to catch us, so it's an important game. Come on!</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Cirencester 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It was closer than might have been expected, but all that matters is that it's yet another win and another step closer to promotion. A first half goal from the excellent  <b>Andy Spencer</b>  has taken us  <b> 15 points clear  of 3rd place Weston</b>  - although they have 2 games in hand - and 6 points clear of Chippenham in second place.</p>
  <p>There's been discussions about setting up an  <b>Official Supporters Club</b>  recently. Read  Kev Crook's letter  for more information on a subject which has already led to some interesting debates.</p>
  <p>The strange way the fixture list works out this year means we host  <b>Moor Green in the Worcester Senior Cup semi-final on Saturday</b>  in an interesting distraction from important matters.</p>

    <h3>Evesham 0 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It just gets better and better. A comfortable 3-0 victory against Evesham coupled with both Weston and Solihull dropping points means we're even further ahead in the  promotion race .</p>
  <p>An early goal from  <b>Neil Smith</b>  settled everyone's nerves, and then another before half-time from  <b>Leroy</b>  just about clinched it the way our defence is playing. A third from  <b>Andy Spencer</b>  finished off an easy victory against one of the better teams in the league.</p>

  <p>Tuesday brings Cirencester to The Grove for the first home league game for ages, and then we host Moor Green in the Worcester Senior Cup semi-final on Saturday.</p>

    <h3>Clevedon 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz took another large step to regaining our place in the Premier League with a late victory at claggy Clevedon. With both Chippenham and Solihull drawing, it was an excellent day for many reasons.</p>
  <p>It was touch and go whether the game was going to be on, and the pitch was pretty awful; very muddy and wet in patches. As has been the case in most matches this year, we dominated the game but it was very difficult to play and their keeper made a couple of excellent saves in the second half, especially one from a first-time Leroy volley.</p>
  <p>Finally in the 89th minute we got a penalty after Andy Spencer must have been pushed - although no one I spoke to could say for certain - when left with a free header right in front of goal. Jason scared us all by slamming it in off the bar, and then we finished the game off in style when Dennis Bailey was put through and he coolly slotted it away. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Our next game is at Evesham on Saturday which may be a little tricky but let's hope for another 3 points.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Clevedon Town: Matthews; Simeon Allison, Lester, Vinnicombe, Jefferies (Thorne 39), Price, Zabek, Mills, Bright (Morrisey 64), Sam Allison, Palmer. Sub: Dorrian.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Skidmore, Spencer, Bailey, May (Jones 83), Taylor, Hines. Subs: Newell, Ross.</p>
  <p>Referee: T. Curtis (Bath) Attendance: 361 Booked: None</p>
  <p>Dreadful weather conditions seem to be a hallmark of recent games at Clevedon and this proved no exception. Both sides were clogged-up with mud for most of the afternoon, so it took two late injury-time goals to give the Yeltz all three points at much-changed Clevedon.</p>
  <p>With the mud ankle-deep in patches, it was questionable whether the game should have taken place at all, but Halesowen proved once again that when necessary they can out-battle the opposition as well as play attractive football. Goal chances were inevitably scarce with the ball unable to roll freely in the quagmire conditions - made even worse by a gusty wind.</p>
  <p>In the farcical conditions Richard Colwell planted in a 9th minute cross that was headed away and the resulting corner from Les Hines was cleared. Dave Bright hit a weak Tim Clarke clearance wide of the mark for the home side two minutes later. Dennis Bailey then clipped just wide in the 21st minute and Halesowen went close as Leroy May's shot was turned over the bar by goalkeeper Jason Matthews in the 24th minute. Hines struck just over after 33 minutes and five minutes before the break Clevedon's Simeon Allison hit the ball out of the penalty area mud over the bar.</p>
  <p>Halesowen continued to be on top in the second-half, although Bright hit wide for Clevedon when Clarke was caught off his line after 55 minutes. &#xD;
Two minutes later Andy Spencer's persistence almost led to a goal but the ball deflected cruelly wide of the mark. &#xD;
Goalkeeper Matthews then denied the Yeltz twice on the hour by turning away a May volley and then producing a fine save to keep out Andy Spencer's header from the corner. Stuart Skidmore saw his 76th minute shot from the edge of the box collected by Matthews.</p>
  <p>With the game heading for a goal-less draw, the league leaders were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute when Bailey crossed from the left and goalkeeper Matthews pushed Spencer who was lurking menacingly at the far post. Jason BURNHAM gladly crashed home his 7th penalty of the season off the underside of the bar for a vital lead. Two minutes into stoppage time BAILEY then latched onto a long ball and escaped his marker before slotting home Halesowen's second.</p>
