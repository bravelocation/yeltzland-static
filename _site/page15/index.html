    <h3>Yeltz P Weston P</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Bad weather again, and our game was called off because of a waterlogged pitch. With Brendan away perhaps it's not too bad these games being cancelled, and he's back next Saturday but too late to get to Clevedon according to the Halesowen News (!). Seeing as we've played more than most, I don't think any potential backlog is going to hurt us.</p>
  <p>Once again Chippenham could only draw 1-1 at home in their rearranged game at home to Sutton Coldfield, so they're still a point behind having played a game more. It's completely in our hands now.</p>
  <p>Next week is an important game down at Clevedon. They've only got an outside chance of catching us, but a win for us would completely put them out of it. Come on!</p>

    <h3>WSC  Yeltz 1 Evesham 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>As we continued our epic march through the Worcestershire Senior Cup, much more importantly we stayed on  top of the table  when Chips and Ham could only draw in their game in hand against our friends in Gloucester.</p>
  <p>Our game was won by another Jason Burnham penalty and continues our excellent run of late. However, we've got two very important league games coming up - first Weston come to The Grove on Saturday, and then the week after we travel to Clevedon in another promotion showdown. It's all getting very exciting.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Crawford, Hines, Newell, Burnham, G. Smith, Skidmore (L. Collins 60), Jones, Ross (Phillips 73), Hall (Spencer &#xD;
79). Subs: N. Smith, Garvey</p>
  <p>Evesham United: Steadman; Parmenter, Wolsey, Clark, Pendleton, Cunnington (Lutz 68), Mullen, McCartan, Taylor, Brown, Preedy. Subs: Maybury, &#xD;
Benjamin, Staley, Pratt</p>
  <p>Referee: D. Hine (Worcester) Attendance: 201 Booked: Taylor (30), Wolsey (53), Preedy (83), L. Collins (86) Sent Off: Wolsey (62)</p>
  <p>Halesowen progressed to the Worcs. Senior Cup semi-final where they will meet Moor Green.</p>
  <p>In front of a sparse crowd, Matty Hall produced a 2nd minute run and shot &#xD;
which was clawed away by goalkeeper Darren Steadman in a much-changed &#xD;
Halesowen line-up. Tim Clarke returned the gesture by turning away Russell &#xD;
Parmenter's 20-yard shot in the 9th minute. Lee Ross hit over form close &#xD;
range in the 10th minute and Matty Hall sent in two off-the mark shots from &#xD;
good positions as the Yeltz pushed a tough Evesham line-up.</p>
  <p>Evesham had an opportunity to take a 38th minute lead but Scott Mullen &#xD;
slotted wide after Steve Taylor had headed down. In the 42nd minute Gary &#xD;
Smith played a neat 1-2, but inexplicably hit wide when all alone on the &#xD;
penalty spot. The winner came in the last minute of the first half when &#xD;
Mullen tripped Les Hines and Jason BURNHAM despatched his sixth penalty of &#xD;
the season into the centre of goal.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz created more openings in the second half, but could not add to &#xD;
the goal tally. Hines whipped in a 53rd minute free-kick which was gathered &#xD;
well by Steadman with Burnham about to pounce. Evesham were reduced to ten &#xD;
men in the 62nd minute when Mark Wolsey was dismissed for retaliation &#xD;
against Andy Jones. Matty Hall wasted a 70th minute opportunity to increase &#xD;
the lead when he elected to go alone instead of passing across goal to the &#xD;
three unmarked forwards after Lee Ross had set him clear.</p>
  <p>Steadman then kept Evesham in the game with a string of fine saves. Kelvin &#xD;
Phillips, son of manager Brendan, almost rounded Steadman with his first &#xD;
touch of the ball in the 74th minute, but Steadman dived to take the ball. &#xD;
Steadman then saved a fierce Colwell shot with his feet following a fine &#xD;
surging run by the fullback and produced a fine reflex stop from a Jones &#xD;
header a minute later. In the last meaningful chance, Hines cracked the &#xD;
Evesham crossbar from 20 yards out in the 78th minute.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz P Cirencester P</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The whole country's been hit by some awful weather over the last few days, so it was no surprise that the game against Cirencester was called off early Saturday morning because of a waterlogged pitch. As all the other games were off as well, obviously there's been no effect to the table.</p>
  <p>Everyone was saddened by hearing of the death of Brendan's father this week. He's had to go to Jamaica for a couple of weeks to sort things out leaving team affairs in the hands of Mark Taylor, Neil Smith and Tim Clarke.</p>
  <p>Weather permitting, we've got Evesham at home on Tuesday in the Worcester Senior Cup replay, before a game of real consequence at home to  <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/theseagulls/">Weston</a>  in a very important promotion game. Come on!</p>

    <h3>Gloucester 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>That's eight wins out of nine now in the league. It's making  Fantasy Island  a bit easy, but I'm sure (I think) they'll be no complaints from anyone as the mighty Yeltz continue our push for promotion.</p>
  <p>Goals from  <b>Skiddy</b>  and  <b>Lee Ross</b>  meant a exciting victory against old and not always friendly rivals Gloucester. According to Chas, the first one was our 500th away goal in the Southern League which I'm sure caused extra special celebrations at the match. With Weston losing and Solihull drawing we've pulled even further ahead at the  top of the table , with both ourselves and Chippenham in very good positions.</p>
  <p>Chas also suggested the new vote - who's the greatest Yeltz keeper ever? The voting on  The Best Yeltz XI ever  Danny's McDonnell is a big favorite but we'll see if opinion has changed now he's left.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday brings Cirencester to The Grove in what I reckon is their first visit - although as you've probably gathered I'm no expert on this sort of thing.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Gloucester City: Bath; Steadman, Marshall, Griffiths, Prince (Howard 85), &#xD;
McCluskey, Burns, Jenkins, Bayliss, L. Smith, Cook (Webb 56). Sub: Archer</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Skidmore, &#xD;

  <p>Referee: M. Gooding (Bristol) Attendance: 476 Booked: Cook (54), Ross (61), Skidmore (68)</p>
  <p>A solid Halesowen performance ended Gloucester's eight-game unbeaten run &#xD;
and they were set on their way by a superb Stuart Skidmore strike to notch &#xD;
Halesowen's 500th away goal in their Southern League history.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started strongly with Les Hines stabbing wide in the 5th minute &#xD;
and Gloucester goalkeeper collecting a deflected shot from Stuart Skidmore &#xD;
five minutes later. But Will Steadman headed wide with the goal at his &#xD;
mercy for Gloucester from a Lee Smith cross in the 11th minute and a poor &#xD;
throw-out by Halesowen goalkeeper Tim Clarke saw Steadman drive a shot just &#xD;
inches high from 20 yards out.</p>
  <p>The league leaders took a 20th minute lead when Lee Ross headed on for Andy &#xD;
Spencer to lay the ball off for SKIDMORE to hit a screaming volley into the &#xD;
roof of the net from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>Gloucester then enjoyed a good spell of pressure before but Lee Smith saw &#xD;
his 30th minute shot blocked by the Halesowen defence from Darren &#xD;
McCluskey's free-kick. The Tigers came within an ace of equalising through &#xD;
Gary Marshall in the 33rd minute, but Clarke did well to smother his shot &#xD;
on the goal-line. Just before half-time a fierce cross from Hines was met &#xD;
by Spencer but he blazed over from three yards out and Gloucester &#xD;
goalkeeper Matt Bath produced a fine double save to deny Jason Burnham's &#xD;
15-yard shot before turning Spencer's follow-up for a corner.</p>
  <p>The Tigers worked hard for an equaliser in a tough second half but &#xD;
Halesowen were equal to the battle and were superior in their neat approach &#xD;
play. Leroy May set up Lee Ross to blast wide in the 46th minute and a &#xD;
minute later a cross from Steadman went straight across the face of &#xD;
Clarke's goal at the other end. The in-form May then hit just wide after 58 &#xD;
minutes.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz went two goals up when Hines curled in a 74th minute free-kick &#xD;
which was headed behind and from the resulting corner Hines hit a cross to &#xD;
find playmaker Mark Taylor and he rolled the ball across goal for ROSS to &#xD;
poke home.</p>
  <p>Gloucester should have scored a consolation goal when Luke Prince crossed &#xD;
from the left in the 84th minute but Marshall hit over the bar when well &#xD;
placed. Halesowen substitute Gary Smith saw his close-range 89th minute &#xD;
strike from May's cross disallowed for offside.</p>

    <h3>BSC  Yeltz 0 Birmingham City 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz were beaten 3-0 by a surprisingly experienced Blues side in a match used by Brendan to give a few players a run out who haven't been regulars recently. It's always nice to win, but as I always say these Senior Cups are completely inconsequential so it doesn't matter one bit at all. Full details in the  match reports .</p>
  <p>We're back in league action with a  <b>trip down to Gloucester on Saturday</b>  where we've had some "interesting" visits before.</p>

  <p>Referee:  G. Aston (Wall Heath) Attendance: 532</p>
  <p>Halesowen bowed out of the Birmingham Senior Cup and were well beaten by a strong Blues line-up. Craig Fagan set Birmingham on the road to victory by glancing home a left &#xD;
wing cross from Bryan Hughes in the 9th minute. Home youngster Andy Spencer &#xD;
brought a 20th minute save out of Nico Vaesan, but it was Halesowen &#xD;
goalkeeper Tim Clarke who was kept on his toes for most of the evening. &#xD;
Clarke saved a looping header from Jerry Gill in the 22nd minute before &#xD;
tipping over a 20-yard effort from Bryan Hughes on the half-hour.</p>
  <p>Lee Ross hit a speculative shot wide from a Clarke clearance after 40 &#xD;
minutes for the Yeltz, but the lively Andy Johnson kept the Halesowen &#xD;
defence busy with John Newall making an impressive home debut. Johnson &#xD;
rounded Clarke early in the second half but the home defence cleared. &#xD;
Clarke then smothered a 50th minute shot from McCarthy and saved from Andy &#xD;
Johnson after he played a clever pass with Hughes a minute later.</p>
  <p>Fagan struck again for the visitors on the hour by blasting past Clarke &#xD;
after being set up by McCarthy. A third goal followed in the 66th minute &#xD;
when McCarthy found space in the penalty area to beat Clarke from 10-yards &#xD;
out.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 Bilston 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After what's seemed like ages, the mighty Yeltz continued their promotion run by beating local rivals Bilston 3-0 at The Grove.</p>
  <p>Second half goals from  <b>Andy Spencer</b>  - his 5th in as many league games -  <b>Jason Burnham</b>  (another pen) and  <b>Dennis Bailey</b> , who comes and goes almost as often as Evran Wright Wright Wright, kept us on the  top of the table .</p>
  <p>With Chippenham beating Clevedon and Weston also winning there's no real change at the top, other than I think there really are only 4 teams in contention for the two promotion spots.</p>
  <p>Tuesday brings  <b>Blues</b>  to The Grove in a  <b>B'ham Senior Cup</b>  tie. According to the ever reliable Halesowen News Brendan will try and give a few non-regulars a run out, which is completely the right thing to do as all that matters this year (any year?) is the league. Be nice to keep our winning run going all the same. After that, we've got a  <b>trip down to Gloucester next Saturday</b>  where we've had some "interesting" visits before.</p>
  <p>Also there is  <b>a meeting for all supporters on Thursday 17th</b>  in the Yeltz Bar &#xD;
from 7.30 to 8.45pm - a meet the players evening. Also, it may provide a &#xD;

  <p>Referee: H. Singh (West Bromwich) Attendance: 619 Booked: Ball (64) Sponsors Man of the Match : Lee Collins</p>
  <p>Halesowen hit three goals in the final half-hour to break the Steelmen's resistance and eventually notch a comfortable victory.</p>
  <p>Spencer should have opened the scoring with the first attack in the 2nd &#xD;
minute when a flowing move ended with Leroy May finding Spencer unmarked &#xD;
eight yards out but, after turning, his shot dribbled agonisingly wide. The &#xD;
influential Mark Taylor then put May free but his effort was cleared for a &#xD;
corner. Bilston were much changed from the team the Yeltz played in Nove  &#xD;
mber and started on the back-foot although the ageing Charlie Blakemore saw &#xD;
his 8th minute shot blocked.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to apply the first half pressure and in the 17th minute &#xD;
Stuart Skidmore had a shot cleared off the line by Quentin Townsend after &#xD;
Dennis Bailey had weaved through the Bilston defence. Taylor then lofted a &#xD;
free-kick from the edge of the area just high and Spencer volleyed wide &#xD;
when Bailey had headed down. After 32 minutes Bailey then laid off a long &#xD;
goalkick from Tim Clarke to Spencer again but the Bilston defence blocked &#xD;
as he charged towards goal. A minute later Bailey headed a Taylor corner &#xD;
just wide and 8 minutes before the break Jason Burnham fired in a 20 yard &#xD;
shot which was well held by goalkeeper Simon Bryan. Man of the match Lee &#xD;
Collins received lengthy treatment to a cut head just before the interval &#xD;
after being caught by Lee Bullimore.</p>
  <p>An exciting second half started with Spencer just off target again with a &#xD;
header after both Bailey and May had headed on. The visitors then missed a &#xD;
golden opportunity to snatch the lead in the 51st minute when Clarke failed &#xD;
to gather a Danny Coates corner, but Stuart Grosvenor headed over from just &#xD;
3 yards out when unmarked.</p>
  <p>At the Shed End, Les Hines fired a 20-yard shot onto the top of the net and &#xD;
a delightful 55th minute cross from Taylor was met with a Bailey header, &#xD;
but the ball struck the post and rebounded into safety. Bilston then missed &#xD;
another great chance when Lee Bullimore could only glance a free header &#xD;
wide from another Coates cross.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally broke through on the hour when Taylor played the ball out &#xD;
to Hines on the left wing and his cross was met with a firm downwards &#xD;
header by SPENCER rushing into the box to record his 4th goal in three &#xD;
games. Just two minutes later Hines was brought down in the area by Steve &#xD;
Ball, and after Hines received treatment, BURNHAM stepped up to stroke the &#xD;
penalty home in the 64th minute.</p>
  <p>Hard working Bilston never looked likely to stage a recovery although &#xD;
substitute Greg Walters saw a shot drift wide after 73 minutes. With &#xD;
Halesowen seeking more goals, a corner from Hines after 76 minutes saw the &#xD;
ball cleared off the line in a goalmouth scramble. A minute from time, &#xD;
Halesowen hit a third goal in a fine move started in midfield by Taylor &#xD;
setting Hines free on the left to deliver an inch-perfect cross for BAILEY &#xD;
to tap home.</p>

    <p>
  <p>An excellent way to finish what's been a difficult year. Despite being 2-1 down at one point, we came back in style to clinch an easy victory against old rivals Atherstone to maintain our position on  top of the table . Goals from  <b>Bailey, two from Spencer, one from Gary Smith and an own goal</b>  means we go into 2002 in a very strong position to regain our place in the Premier Division.</p>

  <p>Halesowen warmed up a freezing Atherstone afternoon with a festive feast of goals despite going behind early in the game. The win kept up the pressure &#xD;
at the top of the table with the Yeltz reaching 50 points.</p>
  <p>In the first minute Ross Collins won a corner which Dale Belford lost in the blinding sunlight. Just a minute later, the Yeltz made a perfect start &#xD;
when slack defending let Dennis Bailey turn to crack into the top corner &#xD;
from 20 yards. The Adders levelled five minutes later when Emeka Ejiofor &#xD;
split the defence and put Leon Doughty clear to fire between the legs of &#xD;
Tim Clarke. Poor defending gave the home side a 13th minute lead when Lee &#xD;
Middleton squared across the penalty area from the right for Doughty to hit &#xD;
his second goal home from 5 yards, despite the best efforts of Richard &#xD;
Colwell to clear.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen attempting to fight back, Lee Collins headed Taylor's corner &#xD;
over the bar and brother Ross shot at Belford before being stretchered off &#xD;
with a badly gashed ankle in the 21st minute. Ejiofor then hit past the &#xD;
post in the 27th minute and Neil Smith saw his header cleared off the line &#xD;
by Adam Hart a minute later. On the half-hour Gary Smith laid off the ball &#xD;
for Bailey, forcing Belford to make a fine save.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were back on terms with an easy equaliser in the 33rd minute when &#xD;
Gary Smith rolled the ball from the left for Andy Spencer to calmly place &#xD;
home from 12 yards. Spencer returned the compliment on the stroke of half-time by supplying Gary Smith to hit home from close range and regain &#xD;
Halesowen's lead. Tim Clarke was alert to save from Ejiofor in first half &#xD;
stoppage time as the Adders attacks continued to be direct.</p>
  <p>A slip by Neil Smith almost let in Ejiofor after 47 minutes, but Clarke &#xD;
saved the danger. However, the second half started in much quieter fashion &#xD;
from the frantic goal action of the first and it wasn't until 60 minutes &#xD;
that Dennis Bailey had an overhead kick tipped over by Belford. Halesowen &#xD;
then went 4-2 ahead when Adam Hart hit the ball into his own net when &#xD;
attempting to clear Colwell's right wing cross on 66 minutes. Bailey hit &#xD;
the bar two minutes from time from just 8 yards out after Hines had crossed &#xD;
from the left following good play by Gary Smith. In the final minute Andy &#xD;
Spencer burst forward to crack Halesowen's fifth goal into the bottom &#xD;
corner from 20 yards.</p>

    <h3>Redditch 1 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz got back to winning ways after Saturday's blip, but not after yet another scare. After having much of the play in the first half, we went one down to Redditch before three reasonably late goals clinched an important victory and kept us  on top of the league .</p>
  <p>As mentioned before, I'm on my holidays so please excuse the slow updates of the site, especially YeltzTalk. Anyway, Saturday takes us to old rivals Atherstone and their delightful ground, and then Evesham come to The Grove on New Year's Day.</p>
</p>

  <p>Referee: J. Farries (Oxford) Attendance: 428 Booked: Harris (79), R. Collins (79)</p>
  <p>Halesowen returned to winning ways thanks to three late goals at the Valley &#xD;
Stadium after dominating the Boxing Day fixture for longs spells. The &#xD;
opening took on almost pantomime proportions with the referee only passing &#xD;
the frozen pitch playable five minutes before the intended kick-off time &#xD;
when he arrived late for the noon kick-off, expecting a 3pm start.</p>
  <p>Halesowen then had the better of the first period with Andy Spencer's 17th &#xD;
minute shot deflected wide for a corner by Nigel Niblett. Lee Collins cut &#xD;
out a dangerous cross from Lee Booth that was heading for fellow striker &#xD;
Paul Danks after 26 minutes. Three minutes later Spencer just failed to &#xD;
connect with a flick-on header from Ross Collins and the returning Dennis &#xD;
Bailey played a clever ball to Leroy May in the 36th minute, but his pass &#xD;
across goal found empty space. Bailey headed Mark Taylor's corner wide &#xD;
after 38 minutes and a minute before half-time Lee Collins headed Jason &#xD;
Burnham's long throw inches past the post.</p>
  <p>However it was Redditch who took the lead against the run of play in the &#xD;
49th minute with their first real chance when Brendan Hackett hit a &#xD;
speculative 25 yard left foot shot into the bottom corner with Halesowen &#xD;
goalkeeper Tim Clarke slow to get down to the ball.</p>
  <p>Just when it seemed like their lack of cutting edge would be their downfall &#xD;
again, Lee Collins popped up to head home an equaliser for Halesowen from &#xD;
Burnham's left-wing cross in the 71st minute. From that point on the result &#xD;
was never in doubt and Ross Collins hit a free header wide before Andy &#xD;
Spencer delivered a cross for Leroy May to make a perfectly timed run to &#xD;
head Halesowen's second goal into the top corner on 81 minutes.</p>
  <p>Halesowen crafted a classic third goal in the last minute when substitute &#xD;
Matty Hall threaded his way through the Redditch defence before passing &#xD;
wide for Hines to deliver a cross for the exciting youngster Spencer to nod &#xD;
home off the inside of the post.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2001/12/22/MERRY-XMAS!.html">MERRY XMAS!</a></h2>
    <h3>Yeltz 0 Chippenham 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The weather was very Christmassy, but the festivities got off to a depressing start as the mighty  <b>Yeltz lost 1-0 to promotion rivals Chippenham</b>  at a freezing Grove.</p>
  <p>It wasn't much of a game in the difficult conditions, although man of the match must have been the Chippenham keeper who made three or four outstanding saves. We had much the better of the first half, and although the second half was more even we didn't really deserve to lose in my completely unbiased opinion.</p>
  <p>We're on holiday here at Yeltzland Towers for a few days, so I'm afraid  <b>the site (and especially  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk"&gt;YeltzTalk</a> ) will get updated even slower than usual</b> . Despite Saturday's result, things are looking a lot brighter than last Xmas. We are still top of what's admittedly quite a poor league, but Brendan's excellent management has brought a wave of optimism not seen for some time now. We are still  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=22122001"&gt;top of the league</a>  and in prime spot to get promoted, so let's not start moaning now.</p>
  <p>Have an very Merry Xmas, and let's hope there'll be some happy Christmas jumper wearers at Redditch on Boxing Day.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, S. Skidmore (G. Smith 77), Spencer, Hall, May, Taylor, R. Collins (Hines 64). Sub: &#xD;
Newall</p>
  <p>Chippenham Town: Weaver; Vickerman, Dicks, Andrews, Rudge, Woods, Brown &#xD;
(Mings 89), Charity, Tweddle, Rawlins, Bent (R. Skidmore 90). Sub: Bright</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Bratt (Walsall) Attendance: 912</p>
  <p>Halesowen dominated with spells of neat passing play but failed to find the &#xD;
net and paid the price when Chippenham scored the winner on the break.</p>
  <p>A bumper crowd saw few early chances as both sides slowly came to terms &#xD;
with a rock hard playing surface. Matty Hall swung in a 10th minute corner &#xD;
which Lee Collins headed over and Andy Spencer headed wide two minutes &#xD;
later when he met Richard Colwell's cross. At the other end Neil Smith &#xD;
cleared from Simon Charity after 20 minutes and Steve Brown swung in a &#xD;
dangerous corner which Tim Clarke temporarily lost.</p>
  <p>Chippenham caused confusion with James Bent (11) and Steve Brown (7) &#xD;
swapping shirts from the numbers given on the official teamsheet.</p>
  <p>Halesowen gradually gained the upper hand and Ross Collins headed over from &#xD;
Mark Taylor's 22nd minute cross. The Yeltz then enjoyed a purple patch &#xD;
before half-time but were kept at bay by the brilliance of Chippenham &#xD;
goalkeeper Steve Weaver and their own failings in front of goal.</p>
  <p>Andy Spencer cleverly flicked the ball past the final defender before &#xD;
volleying high in the 32nd minute and seconds later Stuart Skidmore sent in &#xD;
a screaming 35-yard shot that Weaver saved athletically just under the &#xD;
crossbar. With the visitors pinned back, Leroy May met a 34th minute cross &#xD;
from Jason Burnham but his header was blocked on the line. From the &#xD;
resulting corner May headed against the crossbar and in the ensuing &#xD;
goalmouth scramble Neil Smith blasted well over from 8 yards out. Just &#xD;
before the break Matty Hall hit the side netting after good work from May &#xD;
and Spencer and in a rare counter-attack Chippenham's Matt Rawlins saw his &#xD;
44th minute shot turned away in a crowded home goalmouth.</p>
  <p>Weaver had to be alert two minutes into the second half to claw away a shot &#xD;
from Hall which bounced awkwardly off the frozen pitch as Halesowen &#xD;
continued to press with Chippenham content to play for the draw. Clarke &#xD;
beat away a 54th minute freekick from Grantley Dicks and Hall headed &#xD;
Richard Colwell's cross wide when well placed.</p>
  <p>Disaster struck for Halesowen in the 70th minute when the visitors grabbed &#xD;
an unlikely winner after May allowed Nathan Rudge to head back across goal &#xD;
from a wide angle and hitman Rawlins had the simple task of beating Clarke &#xD;
from five yards out. Chippenham held onto their important winner although &#xD;
Weaver had to make a great save to deny substitute Gary Smith who turned in &#xD;
the box after being put through by Hall three minutes from time.</p>

    <h3>WSC  Evesham 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Worst possible result in my eyes - I've never liked the Senior Cups and at the moment we really don't need the distraction, so it's a pain we have to go to a replay in the Worcestershire version after a 1-1 draw at Evesham. Rosco got our equaliser after we'd gone behind, but I think the attendance - 115 - says it all.</p>
  <p>So it's on to Saturday's top of the table clash with Chippenham at The Grove. Our real rivals are the teams in third place and below, as all that matters this year is finishing in the top two. However a victory would take us seven points clear at the halfway mark - which would be nice. Come on!!!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Evesham United: Watson; A. Smith, Parmenter, Clark, Powell, Lutz, Wolsey, McCartan, Mullen (Roberts 45), Pratt, Preedy. Subs: Brown, Clifton, &#xD;

  <p>Referee: S. Dorr (Worcester) Attendance: 115 Booked: Gray (19), G. Smith (19), L. Collins (43), Wolsey (75), Spencer (75)</p>
  <p>Halesowen and Evesham must replay at The Grove after fighting out an evenly matched quarter-final on a sticky playing surface.</p>
  <p>The visitors went close in the 9th minute when Les Hines played a great ball from his own half for Gary Smith to send a curling shot from the edge &#xD;
of the area which was saved by Danny Watson. Watson then recovered to save &#xD;
the rebound from Matty Hall. Evesham's Phil Preedy then struck wide from &#xD;
the left in the 16th minute.</p>
  <p>Shaun Pratt caused danger for the Halesowen defence in the first half and &#xD;
was instrumental in a 25th minute disallowed goal before cutting in himself &#xD;
two minutes later, causing Tim Clarke to make a fine save. At the other end &#xD;
goalkeeper Watson denied Hines from close range and then saved from Hall &#xD;
who latched onto a long free-kick from Jason Burnham on the half-hour.</p>
  <p>The home side took a 42nd minute lead when Preedy skipped past the &#xD;
Halesowen defence down the left to hit past Clarke from a tight angle.</p>
  <p>Halesowen gradually fought back in the second half with Hines driving in a &#xD;
46th minute freekick before levelling in the 59th minute when Hall put in a &#xD;
low right wing cross for Ross Collins to net from a couple of yards out. &#xD;
Watson then made a reflex save after 65 minutes to deny Ross Collins again &#xD;
before Evesham's Pratt headed a corner from Steve McCartan wide in the 72nd &#xD;
minute. In the dying moments Andy Spencer set Ross Collins free but Watson &#xD;
blocked again and Steve McCartan hit high for Evesham when well placed.</p>

    <h3>Gresley 0 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Another clean sheet added to another few goals, and the mighty Yeltz march onwards towards next week's important clash against Chippenham in extremely good spirits.</p>
  <p>Goals from  <b>Spencer</b> ,  <b>Matty Hall</b>  and  <b>Les</b>  led to our first win at Gresley for 17 years (the word according to Chas), who had been on a good run themselves. The only piece of bad news was new bloke Lee Ross limping off with a hamstring injury.</p>
  <p>With Clevedon losing we're now  7 points clear  in the promotion standings, and still four points clear of Chippenham although they have a game in hand.</p>
  <p>Tuesday takes us to  <b>Evesham</b>  in the always exciting Worcester Senior Cup, before next Saturday  <b>Chippenham come to The Grove</b>  in a game that it looks like will have a huge impact on the title race. Come on!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Gresley Rovers: Lindley; Bluck (Peters 32), Cheetham, Allcock, Woolley, Wardle, Bourne, Fairbrother, Ford, Parkins (Moran 84), Gray (Westwood 57)</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Skidmore, Spencer, Ross (Hall 23), May, Taylor, Hines. Subs: Crawford, G. Smith</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Dawes (Willenhall) Attendance: 496 Booked: Hall (46), Gray (48), Allcock (89)</p>
  <p>Halesowen underlined their promotion credentials with an emphatic victory in a potentially tricky meeting at in-form Gresley.</p>
  <p>The home side started brightly playing up the slope and Tim Clarke did well to hold onto a fierce freekick from Ryan Ford in the 6th minute. Neil Smith &#xD;
made a timely tackle to deny Ford in the area after 22 minutes before &#xD;
Halesowen took control. Despite losing Lee Ross with a hamstring injury, &#xD;
the visitors went on the attack with Andy Spencer playing a key role in &#xD;
supporting the front-line from midfield. The Yeltz went ahead when the &#xD;
lively Leroy May worked down the left allowing Jason Burnham to deliver a &#xD;
fine 34th minute cross and Spencer stole in at the far post to side-foot &#xD;
home from close range.</p>
  <p>Gresley were overwhelmed by Halesowen's neat passing game in the second half and it was no surprise when the league leaders scored a second in the &#xD;
59th minute. Richard Colwell split the Gresley defence, setting Matty Hall &#xD;
free to cross to Les Hines and although his shot was parried away by &#xD;
goalkeeper James Lindley, Hall was lurking to tap home the rebound.</p>
  <p>Well beaten Gresley gifted Halesowen a third goal in the 76th minute when &#xD;
Hall robbed Mark Peters and rolled the ball into the path of Les Hines and &#xD;
he made no mistake with a pinpoint 15 yard shot. The tenacious Stuart &#xD;
Skidmore rushed in to blast a Hall cross just over in the 82nd minute and &#xD;
May hit wide two minutes from time as Halesowen sought more goals in their &#xD;
first victory at the home of their long-term rivals since 1984.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Yeltz go goal crazy! With all the  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/"&gt;talk</a>  about our lack of goal power and needing new strikers, maybe things aren't so bad after all. Points clear at the  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=08122001"&gt;top of the table</a> , a second half goal-fest sent the Yeltz fans home very happy indeed.</p>
  <p>We led 1-0 at half-time through yet another  <b>Jason Burnham penalty</b> . We went further ahead through goals from  <b>Leroy</b>  and new bloke  <b>Lee Ross</b> , and then three late goals from  <b>Matty Hall (2) and Gary Smith</b>  led to our biggest win for ages (answers to  <a href="/haveyoursay/yeltztalk/"&gt;YeltzTalk</a>  please).</p>
  <p>Bizarrely enough, according to Ceefax  <b>both Clevedon and Chippenham also won 6-0</b> , but we've obviously maintained our 4 point lead at the top. The game in two weeks time against Chippenham is going to be a stormer. However, before that next Saturday takes us back to old rivals  <b>Gresley</b> , who we beat 3-0 at The Grove in the first game of the season.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Despite everyone feeling a little down on how things have been going, suddenly  <b>the mighty Yeltz have gone back to the  top of the league </b>  and started to pull away from the chasing pack.

  <p>We lead at half-time through another  <b>Jason Burnham penalty</b> , and after being pegged back to one-all we took all 3 points from a  <b>Neil Smith 20 yard screamer</b> .</p>
  <p>There's finally been some activity on the transfer front.  <b>We've signed forward Lee Ross from Bloxwich</b>  for a supposed four figure sum, and let Kerry Giddings go to Redditch on loan for a while. We've also rumoured to have signed a forward from Crewe on loan.</p>
  <p> <b>Bedworth's</b>  Trophy game was called off today which means our league  <b>game on Tuesday</b>  against them  <b>is off</b>  as well. This means our next game will be against Shepshed again at The Grove on Saturday.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Shepshed Dynamo: Quailey; Folwell, Simpson, Goodwin, Lawrence, Commander, Holtom, Dunn, Blake (Heskey 84), McGlinchey, Master. Subs: Manning, &#xD;
Newbold</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, R. Collins, Spencer, Ross (Hall 80), May, Taylor (Crawford 40), Hines. Subs: G. Smith.</p>
  <p>Referee: P. Kirkup (Northampton) Attendance: 240 Booked: Lawrence (41) Sent Off: Lawrence (79)</p>
  <p>Halesowen went four points clear at the top of the table, but had to rely on a rare late strike from Neil Smith after threatening to run up a cricket score in the first half.</p>
  <p>Tim Clarke was on hand to make important early saves from Carl Lawrence and Andy Dunn on rare breaks by the home side, but for much of the first half &#xD;
it was one-way traffic towards the Shepshed goal. Ross Collins and Lee Ross &#xD;
both sent volleys high over the goal and Mark Taylor had a free-kick saved &#xD;
by Damion Quailey in the opening spell.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz eventually took the lead when Jason Burnham crashed home his third penalty of the week after Carl Lawrence needlessly handled over his &#xD;
head in the penalty area after 22 minutes. But Halesowen had to be &#xD;
satisfied with a single first half goal as a number of chances continued to &#xD;
go begging. Debut boy Lee Ross blasted wide from a good position and in the &#xD;
28th minute May broke clear and rolled the ball across goal to Mark Taylor, &#xD;
but he struck the post from just 2 yards out. Quailey then produced a &#xD;
splendid save to turn a header from Leroy May for a corner. At the other &#xD;
end Clarke pulled out a good save from a 25-yard free-kick from Kirk &#xD;
Master.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were forced to reorganise in the 40th minute due to injury to Mark Taylor and the change seemed to throw the visitors off balance. &#xD;
Halesowen paid the price for their earlier misses when Shepshed levelled &#xD;
out of the blue in the 56th minute as the dangerous Kirk Master picked up &#xD;
the ball in midfield and ran into the area to hit home into the bottom of &#xD;
the net from 15 yards. For a twenty minute spell Shepshed were transformed &#xD;
and looked the more likely to snatch a winner with Clarke having to make a &#xD;
fine blocking save from Marvin Blake who was clear on goal on the hour.</p>
  <p>May headed onto the top of Shepshed's net from close range with the home defence in chaos before Halesowen were finally claimed the three points &#xD;
that seemed a first half certainty. Ross held up the ball in the area in &#xD;
the 78th minute allowing Neil Smith to smash a 20 yard drive beyond &#xD;
Quailey. With Shepshed's Lawrence being sent off for arguing, Halesowen &#xD;
were content to hold onto the lead although Les Hines went close two &#xD;
minutes from time but was denied by Quailey.</p>

    <h3>Stourport 2 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In a fantastic comeback, the mighty Yeltz gained 3 important points when they came back from 2-0 down to beat local rivals Stourport Swifts 3-2.  <b>Two second half penalties by Jason Burnham</b>  and a late winner following a goal mouth scramble - Chas reckons  <b>Gary Smith</b>  got it - has kept us right in the promotion race.</p>
  <p>It's difficult to say exactly where we are in the  table  as there are strong rumours suggesting  <b>Bloxwich United have resigned from the league</b>  immediately.  <b>If that's confirmed</b>  then it will help us as Chippenham, Clevedon and Solihull have all beaten Bloxwich, whereas we haven't yet played them, and I reckon  <b>we'd go top of the league!</b> </p>
  <p>There are still persistent rumours of new signings, but nothing confirmed as yet. More news as soon as I hear, but it'll appear on  first .</p>
  <p>Saturday brings another away trip, this time a particularly glamorous tie against  <b>Shepshed Dynamo</b> .</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Stourport Swifts: Hipkins; Ulfig, Laker, Townsend, Mullders, Shaw, Southwick, Langford, Marsh, Booth, Nicholls. Subs: Hart, Cooper, Davies</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, R. Collins, Hall (Spencer 66), Jones (G. Smith 45), Giddings, Taylor, Carter (Crawford &#xD;
66)</p>
  <p>Referee: K. Hawkes (Quedgeley, Glos.) Booked: R. Collins (29)</p>
  <p>A game that was steadily heading for a dismal defeat against a scratch &#xD;
Stourport side suddenly turned into an evening that will become Yeltz &#xD;
folklore in the years to come. Halesowen started the day in 5th place in &#xD;
the table, 5 points behind Chippenham at the top and 4 points behind both &#xD;
Solihull and Clevedon. After 70 minutes Halesowen were trailing 2-0 to &#xD;
Stourport. What happened next? Well, suffice to say Halesowen ended the &#xD;
evening at the top of the table. How did it happen?</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued where they left off on Saturday. Plenty of possession, &#xD;
but with their attacks breaking down in the final third. However, this time &#xD;
the defence could not keep up their remarkable record and Stourport took &#xD;
the lead in their first attack after 27 minutes when Lea Shaw diverted home &#xD;
a cross from Matt Southwick with Richard Colwell unable to clear. Tim &#xD;
Clarke then made a tremendous blocking save from Lee Booth who was clear on &#xD;
goal in the 44th minute. However, on the stroke of half-time a free-kick &#xD;
from Southwick was headed on by Steve Ulfig and the ball squirmed past &#xD;
Clarke into the bottom corner to end a disastrous half for Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Gary Smith replaced Andy Jones and worked hard using his experience but the &#xD;
real turning point came with the introduction of the adventurous Andy &#xD;
Spencer in the 66th minute. With Ross Collins suddenly fired up, the Yeltz &#xD;
looked more menacing. Ross Collins was bundled over on a run in the 68th &#xD;
minute and Jason Burnham smashed the resulting penalty down the centre of &#xD;
the goal. Hope renewed. In the 75th minute Mark Taylor worked into the box &#xD;
and was tripped by Southwick for a second penalty. Burnham calmly repeated &#xD;
his previous effort by crashing a piledriver into the top of the net for an &#xD;
equaliser. The winner came against a bemused Stourport in the 90th minute &#xD;
when a corner from Taylor was pushed forward towards the goal-line by Neil &#xD;
Smith and in a forest of legs, Gary Smith poked into the goal from about a &#xD;
foot out. Players, officials and supporters all went into ecstasy.</p>
  <p>Let me complete the puzzle. Earlier in the day, news filtered through that Bloxwich had failed to fulfil their evening fixture against Bilston and as &#xD;
a result of a meeting the previous evening had in fact resigned from the &#xD;
league. A quick look at the results grid showed that Halesowen had yet to &#xD;
play them, whereas the top three had already beaten them. Using a word that &#xD;
only seems to get used when a team goes bust, the record of Bloxwich was &#xD;
"expunged" , leaving Halesowen at the top. An unlikely outcome from only 20 &#xD;
minutes earlier!!</p>

    <h3>RC Warwick 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We've only scored 5 goals in our last 6 league games, and it's a bit worrying. If Les had scored a first half penalty we might have snuck three points at Warwick, but as it was all we got out of the game was a point in a 0-0 draw.</p>
  <p>I'm sure evryone's as concerned as me that simply being solid at the back isn't going to be enough to get us up. However, I'm also sure Brendan is on the case, as can be shown by his attempts to make a move in the transfer market. I have every confidence that it will get sorted.</p>
  <p>Anyway, it's not really that bad. We're still right in the hunt in  5th place  and have an important game at Stourport on Tuesday. We stuffed them at The Grove earlier in the season, so let's hope for more of the same at their place.</p>

  <p>Halesowen's season is in danger of faltering as they once again struggled to find the net despite dominating their opponents and being awarded a &#xD;
penalty. The Yeltz have now only notched a paltry 5 goals on their league &#xD;
travels - the worst record in the division.</p>
  <p>For the home side Dave Jackson threaded through midfield in the 13th minute but shot well wide. A 19th minute corner from Mark Taylor was easily &#xD;
cleared. With Racing Club Warwick unable to muster a decent scoring &#xD;
opportunity all afternoon, it was left to the visitors to try to break the &#xD;
deadlock, but they were guilty of poor final delivery and missing a host of &#xD;
chances in front of goal. The Yeltz were handed a gift in the 29th minute &#xD;
when Dave Jackson was judged to have tripped Stuart Skidmore in the penalty &#xD;
area - a decision that lead to a huge protest from the home defence. &#xD;
However, even this golden opportunity was wasted when Les Hines hit the &#xD;
spotkick at hand height allowing goalkeeper Matt Tucker to save diving to &#xD;
his left. Taylor then volleyed just wide in the 32nd minute and Tucker held &#xD;
onto an Andy Jones cross at full stretch two minutes before half-time</p>
  <p>Halesowen were well on top in the second period with Matty Hall finding &#xD;
plenty of space to run at the Warwick rearguard.&#xD;
Just after the break Gary Smith won a corner which led to an almighty &#xD;
goalmouth scramble in which Hall and Andy Jones failed to connect from just &#xD;
two yards out and ended with Lee Collins firing high. Neil Smith then &#xD;
misdirected a header in front of goal from a Les Hines cross in the 55th &#xD;
minute and a minute later Jones headed a cross from Taylor against the &#xD;
crossbar from close range with no-one able to take advantage of the &#xD;
inviting rebound. Another loose ball ran across the Warwick goalmouth &#xD;
without finding a finishing touch in the 83rd minute when substitute Alfie &#xD;
Carter won a header from a free-kick. With Jones flashing a 90th minute &#xD;
header over the bar from a corner, the subdued Yeltz fans had to settle for &#xD;
just a single point.</p>

    <p>
  <p>It's been a few years since we used to have regular battles against Hednesford, so it was nice to put one over our old rivals even if it was just the Senior Cup. Goals from Skiddy and Jonah put us through to the next round in the most prestigious of the Senior Cups (I always talk them up when we win).</p>
  <p>It was a bit of a disappointing turnout for the supporters' meeting on Monday, with only six committed fans turning up. Unfortunately this doesn't surprise me too much, as it's a lot easier to leave a message of support on the site than it is to actually do something about it. The people who leave messages are always more likely to be younger fans who have internet access.</p>

strong line-up.</p>
  <p>Matty Hall made a couple of impressive early runs down the right wing for the home side but he blasted high in the 2nd minute and his third minute &#xD;
cross failed to find a Yeltz striker. Phil Trainer flashed a 13th minute &#xD;
shot wide and Andy Brownrigg's shot was easily saved by Tim Clarke a couple &#xD;
of minutes later for the visitors.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz took the lead in the 19th minute when Andy Jones headed back across goal for Stuart Skidmore to turn home his first goal of the season &#xD;
from close range. Stuart Lake then stole in on the Halesowen defence in the &#xD;
23rd minute from a Kevin Francis header, but he headed weakly into Clarke's &#xD;
arms.</p>
  <p>Three minutes after half-time Skidmore set up Alfie Carter for a left wing run but his cross was cleared by the Hednesford defence. On 57 minutes Gary &#xD;
Smith set Carter free again but the break came to nothing. Stuart Airdrie &#xD;
curled a teasing 55th minute shot just wide as Kenny Hibbitt's Hednesford &#xD;
tried to get back into the game, but it was visiting goalkeeper Mark Gayle &#xD;
who had to turn a diving header around the post from Jones in the 71st &#xD;
minute from another Hall cross. Stuart Lake then had an 81st minute shot &#xD;
from 20 yards pushed away for a corner by Clarke.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally doubled the lead and sealed the game in the 85th minute when Smith threaded the ball through for Jones to poke home past Gayle.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Mangotsfield 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We've got used to winning in the league recently - especially at home - so it's a bit disappointing only to draw 1-1 against Mangotsfield. We took the lead in the second half through a Michael Crawford goal, but couldn't hold on to the lead. We've slipped to  4th in the table , but still can go top if we win our games in hand.</p>
  <p>Tuesday brings old rivals Hednesford to The Grove in the B'ham Senior Cup, but don't forget the meeting about the proposed supporters' fund on Monday (19th) in the clubhouse at 8pm.</p>
  <p>Nice to see Canvey beating Wigan in the FA Cup, and also Barrow drawing at Oldham. Puts our performances in some sort of perspective, but it still would have been nice to win today :-)</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Crawford, N. Smith, Burnham, Skidmore, Hall, Jones, Giddings (G. Smith 81), Taylor, Hines. Subs: Gray, R.Collins</p>
  <p>Mangotsfield Utd: Dyson; Pendry, Hallett, Barlass, Russell, Loydon, Sims, Summers, Claridge (Allen 81), Edwards, Winter (Nicholls 81). Sub: Penny</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Lever (Leicester) Attendance: 506 Booked: None</p>
  <p>Halesowen had to wait until the 75th minute to break down plucky &#xD;
Mangotsfield, but then threw away their narrow lead just four minutes later.</p>
  <p>Tim Clarke saved an 8th minute flick from Robert Claridge before Halesowen came strongly into the game. In the 9th minute Matty Hall made a &#xD;
tremendours run against the defence and put Andy Jones clear, but his &#xD;
effort rattled off the crossbar. A minute later Lee Barlass headed a cross &#xD;
by Les Hines over his own bar. From the resulting corner a cross from Hines &#xD;
drifted right across the goalmouth without gaining a final touch.</p>
  <p>However, Mangotsfield were more than a match for Halesowen and had some good chances of their own. Clarke was fortunate when he was able to recover &#xD;
after Adam Sims had rounded him but then stumbled in the 18th minute. Kerry &#xD;
Giddings had a rasping shot saved by visiting goalkeeper Dave Dyson in the &#xD;
23rd minute and Michael Crawford saw a free header easily cleared off the &#xD;
line five minutes later. Giddings then hit a 30th minute volley which was &#xD;
blocked by a packed Mangotsfield defence.</p>
  <p>Halesowen had another let off in the 33rd minute when Clarke came out of his area and his clearance ricocheted off a forward into the path of Darren &#xD;
Edwards, but he volleyed wide of an empty net from the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>Early in the second half a shot from Sims fell kindly to Lee Barlass but he hit high from 8 yards out. Halesowen made little impression at this stage &#xD;
although Dyson cleaned up when Giddings latched onto a poor defensive &#xD;
clearance in the 56th minute.</p>
  <p>Michael Crawford finally broke the deadlock and seemed to have handed Halesowen three points in the 75th minute when he powerfully headed a &#xD;
freekick from Les Hines beyond Dyson. However, Mangotsfield claimed a &#xD;
deserved equaliser in the 79th minute with Andy Summers playing a neat &#xD;
one-two before driving past Clarke from 8 yards out.</p>

    <h3>DMC  Bilston 1 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We're certainly getting through them. Another chance to roll out the 'Let's concentrate on the league' rubbish as we went out of the League Cup to a last minute Bilston winner. We always seem to do badly in this competition, so who cares really?</p>
  <p>If you haven't been following the discussion on  YeltzTalk , there's been a lot of talk of setting up a supporters' fund for new signings. Chairman Nigel Pitt has called a meeting for any interested parties to talk about it  next Monday (19th) in the clubhouse at 8pm.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings Mangotsfield to The Grove in the league. Come On!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bilston Town: Boswell; Leeding, Hillman, Stone, Benton, Baddams (Bastable &#xD;
81), Naylor, Jackson, Habbershaw (Lee 69), Rollason, Smith. Sub: Walters.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Crawford, Knight, L. Collins, Skidmore, &#xD;
Spencer, Jones (Giddings 59), R. Collins (Hall 45), Carter, Hines. Sub: &#xD;
Burnham.</p>
  <p>Referee:  A. McIlravey (Redditch) Attendance: 207 Booked: None</p>
  <p>Halesowen bowed out of the Dr Martens Cup at the first hurdle with a &#xD;
disappointing last minute defeat at financially troubled Bilston.</p>
  <p>Manager Brendan Phillips elected to use several fringe squad players and &#xD;
Ross Collins went close for the Yeltz in the first minute when he burst &#xD;
forward, but the makeshift striker slotted wide of the post. Michael &#xD;
Crawford then drove wide from 20 yards in the 11th minute. Without the &#xD;
influence of Mark Taylor, the Yeltz lost the ball in midfield on several &#xD;
occasions and in the 27th minute it led to Bilston's Mark Habbershaw &#xD;
flashing an effort wide of Tim Clarke's upright. Les Hines delivered a &#xD;
cross of quality on the half-hour to Andy Jones but his header fell just &#xD;
wide of the post. Four minutes later Hines went on a solo run but his shot &#xD;
from 20 yards dipped just over the bar.</p>
  <p>The second half continued in a similar pattern with little prospect of a &#xD;
goal although a shot from Hines was whistling into the net until deflected &#xD;
for a corner by Bilston defender Dave Benton in the 55th minute. Alfie &#xD;
Carter then saw his header fly over the bar from substitute Matty Hall's &#xD;
cross and a 67th minute throw-in from Hines was headed on by Kerry Giddings &#xD;
but Carter struck the side-netting. Hall broke clear in the 70th minute but &#xD;
his shot was deflected for a corner by Steve Hillman. Andy Spencer then hit &#xD;
a good chance against the legs of goalkeeper Matthew Boswell in the 86th &#xD;
minute after being set up by Carter.</p>
  <p>As an attacking force, Bilston had little to offer until the 89th minute &#xD;
when Tim Clarke made a great save to deny a Leon Jackson header. A minute &#xD;
later Jackson hit the winner from 6 yards out when Clarke's defence failed &#xD;
to clear - at least the Yeltz faithful were spared 30 minutes of extra-time &#xD;
on a bitter Bilston night to forget.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2001/11/10/A-GRINDING-VICTORY.html">A GRINDING VICTORY</a></h2>
    <h3>Cirencester 0 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It wasn't pretty, but the mighty Yeltz got an important 3 points by beating an poor Cirencester team 1-0.</p>
  <p>It was a dismal ground, mud puddles in both goalmouths and at least 75% of the crowd of 180-odd were from Halesowen. We tried to play football, but it wasn't really that sort of day and it became a niggling battle. The longer the game went on, the less likely a goal looked until we finally managed to get one through a Rosco close range volley.</p>
  <p>As the cliche goes, these are exactly the sort of games you need to win if you want to win the league, so although the performance wasn't fantastic, let's be really happy with the three points. We've moved back up to  3rd place in the table  with games in hand on all the other leaders so things are going well.</p>
  <p>There's been plenty of talk about the possible signing of ex-Yeltz man Steve Piearce on  YeltzTalk  and also talk about setting up a supporters' fund to finance signings. All I'm going to add is that, as usual, Kev Crook's (KEV WITHOUT TREV) comments make a great deal of sense and I agree with them completely.</p>
  <p>Tuesday takes us to Bilston in the League Cup, and then we host Mangotsfield in the league on Saturday.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Cirencester Town: Sawyer; Minturn, Richardson, Grange, Wollen, Mayo, Toby Clarke (Belcher 70), Horgan, Miller, Godley (J. Carter 62), Terry. Sub: &#xD;
Bass</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Tim Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, Smith, L. Collins, Skidmore, Hall (A. Carter 77), Jones, Giddings, Taylor, R. Collins. Subs: Spencer, &#xD;
Crawford</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Cook (Lyndhurst) Attendance: 182 Booked: Sawyer (36), Terry (45), Hall (45)</p>
  <p>Halesowen came up with another late winner to claim three points against a Cirencester outfit who had been performing better in recent Cup &#xD;
competitions than their lowly league position suggests.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz soaked up early pressure while they got the measure of a very heavy pitch with muddy goalmouths. Tim Clarke saved a 20-yard deflected &#xD;
shot from Andy Minturn after 8 minutes and then scooped the ball off the &#xD;
toe of David Godley. Godley was denied again in the 24th minute - with the &#xD;
help of Neil Smith - as Cirencester employed the direct approach.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started to overcome the home side's physical style near half-time and won three free-kicks on the edge of the penalty area with goalkeeper &#xD;
Kevin Sawyer receiving a booking for handling outside his box. The game &#xD;
then threatened to bubble over with a couple of 20-man brawls in midfield.</p>
  <p>Sawyer made a great save from Ross Collins after 50 minutes and Kerry Giddings had an overhead kick cleared from under the bar. Neil Smith &#xD;
volleyed the resulting corner just high as Halesowen dominated the second &#xD;
half.</p>
  <p>Ross Collins made his mark on the game by hitting wide from a good position in the 74th minute and then forcing a fine save at the foot of the post &#xD;
from Sawyer. He went one better in the 78th minute by tapping home his &#xD;
second goal of the season from an inch perfect cross by find-of-the-season &#xD;
Richard Colwell who battled well down the right wing.</p>
