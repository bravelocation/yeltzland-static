  <p>I haven't got many detailsso far, but in difficult conditions Rocester took the lead from a speculative shot that deceived Tim Clarke. We equalised in the second half after a golamouth scramble, the goal was maybe given to Leroy May (although my contacts aren't sure about this).</p>
  <p>
    We've now slipped to , with Solihull losing but Clevedon, Evesham and Stourport all winning. Saturday brings old rivals Atherstone to The Grove in a game where I'm sure we're going to get back to winning ways.

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, R. Collins (Knight 62), Hall (Spencer 62), Jones, Giddings, Taylor, Hines. Sub: Skidmore</p>
  <p>Cinderford Town: Fisher; Regan, Hopkins, Tomkins, Hook, Truman, Bale, Ince (Stanton 42), Addis, Chiverton (Donovan 19), Harris. Sub: Hayward</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Flanaghan (Wednesfield) Attendance: 472 Booked: Ince (14), R. Collins (61), Clarke (88)</p>
  <p>Halesowen failed to turn chances into goals and crashed to a bitterly &#xD;
disappointing defeat against a walking-wounded Cinderford who recorded &#xD;
their first away win of the season. Cinderford came into the game without &#xD;
two key defenders and left it with four more of their players having &#xD;
received lengthy treatment for injury. Amongst them was ex-Halesowen &#xD;
midfielder James Ince who was stretchered off with a suspected broken &#xD;
ankle.</p>
  <p>Halesowen forced the early pace and won five corners in the first six &#xD;
minutes. Cinderford centre-half Clayton Hook hit the ball over his own bar &#xD;
in the 5th minute from a Kerry Giddings cross and a minute later Lee &#xD;
Collins powered in a header from a Les Hines corner, but goalkeeper Andy &#xD;
Fisher managed to beat away the ball. Even at this stage there was a sense &#xD;
that it was not going to be Halesowen's day and this was compounded when &#xD;
Cinderford took a shock 9th minute lead in their first venture forward. The &#xD;
ageless Adie Harris crossed from the left and Eston Chiverton found his way &#xD;
between two defenders to head home.</p>
  <p>Matty Hall went on a solo run in the 16th minute and delivered a dangerous &#xD;
cross into the box, but there was no striker on hand to capitalise. Early &#xD;
frustration began to creep into the Halesowen play and on another &#xD;
Cinderford break, Mike Regan hit a fierce shot that was headed away by Lee &#xD;
Collins in the 34th minute.</p>
  <p>Lee Collins remained in the thick of the action but was up against &#xD;
Cinderford goalkeeper Fisher who was in fine form all afternoon. In the &#xD;
35th minute another corner from Hines was met by a Lee Collins header, but &#xD;
the ball struck Fisher on the line. From the rebound, Lee Collins made &#xD;
another attempt, but somehow Cinderford again cleared off the line.</p>
  <p>With the Yeltz lacking the final killer touch, Tim Clarke had to make a &#xD;
tremendous save in the 46th minute to keep Cinderford out when he saved a &#xD;
10 yard volley from Simon Truman. Lee Collins then made a glaring miss when &#xD;
brother Ross headed on a cross which Lee took down but then blasted over &#xD;
from close range. Kerry Giddings beat the defence in the 51st minute but &#xD;
hit a good chance wide and Lee Collins then brought out another point blank &#xD;
save on the line from Fisher from a header two minutes later. Disaster &#xD;
struck for Halesowen in the 59th minute when Cinderford broke away for a &#xD;
second goal. Truman's initial shot was blocked but the rebound fell kindly &#xD;
for Daryl Harris to slot home from 8 yards.</p>
  <p>With the confidence of their unbeaten home league record draining away, the &#xD;
Yeltz struggled for an answer and it was Clarke who had to produce a &#xD;
fingertip save from Lyndon Tomkins in the 74th minute. Neil Smith headed a &#xD;
cross from Jason Burnham onto the roof of the net in the 77th minute and &#xD;
Andy Jones turned to hit a shot straight at Fisher in the 83rd minute. &#xD;
Substitute Andy Spencer rattled the Cinderford post in the 87th minute &#xD;
before Halesowen finally gained a reward for all their possession when Lee &#xD;
Collins headed into the top corner of the net from a Les Hines corner in &#xD;
the 89th minute. There was still time enough time for Halesowen to try to &#xD;
rescue a point but their miserable day was summed up when Cinderford &#xD;
cleared two injury time efforts off the line from Hines and Lee Knight.</p>

    <h3>FAC  Yeltz 0 Canvey Island 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A very disappointing result, but at least it removes a distraction from the much more important promotion push. (OK I am clutching at straws)</p>
  <p>We had high hopes before the game, and had maybe the better of the first half without ever threatening, but we're disappointed to go one down just before the break. I hoped we go hell-for-leather in the second half in a good old fashioned Shed End comeback, but despite some rousing support we never really got anywhere and after going two down it was all over. Canvey weren't as impressive as I thought they might be, but are obviously used to winning and did just enough to get through. Good luck to them in the rest of the competition.</p>
  <p>
    In the league, Solihull beat Clevedon so we're still . Saturday brings Cinderford to Town to The Grove in a game that will hopefully bring us back to winning ways.

  <p>Referee:  R. Green (Berkley, Glos.) Attendance: 432 Booked: Mitchell (25)</p>
  <p>Halesowen continue to go from strength to strength with another solid win to consolidate their position at the top of table.</p>
  <p>A tricky run from Les Hines was blocked in the 13th minute and an Andy Jones volley from the rebound was saved well by Sutton goalkeeper Justin &#xD;
Bray. Five minutes later Lee Collins sent a long ball forward to his &#xD;
brother Ross, but Bray dived bravely at his feet to snatch the ball.</p>
  <p>Sutton worked hard but rarely threatened in front of goal although Mark Bellingham shot wide in the 35th minute after Matty Hall was dispossessed &#xD;
in midfield. Halesowen goalkeeper Tim Clarke then spilt a deep 40th minute &#xD;
cross from Tim Steele but his defence escaped.</p>
  <p>Halesowen turned up the heat in the second period with Bray collecting a dangerous low cross from Hall in the 46th minute and Ross Collins saw a &#xD;
header fly just over the bar a minute later.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz went ahead from the penalty spot in the 52nd minute when Kerry Giddings surged into the penalty area and was blatantly up-ended by Stuart &#xD;
Randall with spot-kick expert Hines easily converting the resulting penalty &#xD;
into the bottom corner of the net.</p>
  <p>Hall put Halesowen two goals to the good in the 61st minute when he hit Jason Burnham's swinging free-kick home from a tight angle with the Sutton &#xD;
defence static, expecting the ball to go out of play.</p>
  <p>Halesowen confidently played out the rest of the game with man-of-the-match Neil Smith helping to maintain their ninth successive clean sheet.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, R. Collins, Hall, Jones, Giddings, Taylor, Hines. Subs: Spencer, Skidmore, L. Knight</p>
  <p>Clevedon Town: Matthews; Lester, Thorne, Peters, Jeffries, Price, K. Knight, Callinan (Clode 59), Bayliss, Cook (Smart 79), Badman. Sub: King</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Marriner (Birmingham) Attendance: 453</p>
  <p>Halesowen marched to the top of the table in their seventh straight win at the Grove and set a club record of 750 minutes of football without &#xD;
conceding a goal.</p>
  <p>The early 12.30 start produced a low-key start and both teams seemed to &#xD;
cancel each other out in the first half. Clevedon's Karl Bayliss drove wide &#xD;
in the first minute with the previous league leaders keen to shrug off the &#xD;
five goal mauling by Shepshed the week before. Andy Jones won a free kick &#xD;
on the edge of the area in the 4th minute but Les Hines hit the kick &#xD;
against the defensive wall. In the 18th minute the visitors dealt with a &#xD;
spell of home pressure with deep crosses from Richard Colwell and Hines. &#xD;
Tim Clarke saw Keith Knight's 20th minute free-kick late but made a good &#xD;
save from Tommy Callinan's low header. His opposite number Matthews &#xD;
collected Burnham's 25th minute cross at the second attempt.</p>
  <p>Halesowen livened up after the break and Matty Hall's cross to Kerry &#xD;
Giddings almost caught out the Clevedon defence in the 46th minute. The &#xD;
turning point came in the 49th minute when Clarke dived full length to &#xD;
produce a superb fingertip save from Steve Lester's 20-yard drive. For &#xD;
Halesowen, Andy Jones turned and hit wide after 50 minutes and Giddings &#xD;
almost latched onto a weak back header from central defender Lee Jeffries, &#xD;
but Matthews raced off his line to clear. Giddings then battled through &#xD;
midfield allowing the influential Mark Taylor to set up Hines to shoot just &#xD;
over in the 65th minute.</p>
  <p>Previous league leaders Clevedon missed a golden chance in the 75th minute &#xD;
when confusion between Clarke and Neil Smith allowed the ball to break to &#xD;
Karl Bayliss but he shot high with the goal at his mercy.</p>
  <p>Just when Clevedon looked on course for a point, Halesowen crafted two late &#xD;
goals through the strike pair of Jones and Giddings. Ross Collins laid the &#xD;
ball off for Jason Burnham to cross in the 82nd minute and Jones poked the &#xD;
ball home from close range with Lee Collins also set to pounce. Two minutes &#xD;
later Jones broke free and set up fellow striker Giddings to sidestep his &#xD;
marker and crack home his seventh goal of the season from 20 yards into the &#xD;
bottom corner.</p>

    <h3>FAC  Moor Green 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Another clean sheet, and the mighty Yeltz keep rollin' along.</p>
  <p>
    Goals from  the striker and  the winger capped another impressive display against a team a league higher. As said before the game, it would be an good test of how much we've improved from last year, and we passed with flying colours. We've drawn FA Trophy winners  in the next round which is very exciting.
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Moor Green: Rachel (De Bont 87); Gillard, Brighton, Crisp (Joyce 79), Gaunt, Hayde, Peer (Scheppel 64), Lamey, Gayle, Martin, Petty. Subs: Robinson, Mulholland</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, R. Collins (Skidmore 68), Hall, Jones (G. Smith 82), Giddings, Taylor, Hines. Subs: Spencer, Knight, Garvey (GK)</p>
  <p>Referee:  M. Murphy (Coventry) Booked: R. Collins (17), Hayde (36), L. Collins (41), Gayle (47), Taylor (90)  Attendance: 561</p>
  <p>For the first time this season Halesowen started as underdogs in a contest that would show just how much progress has been made so far this season. The verdict was that Halesowen passed the test with flying colours against high-flying Moor Green to record a richly deserved win - the first defeat for Moor Green at home in 7 outings. Certainly recent results between the teams in cup ties suggested Halesowen were more than due a victory, but the nature of the win with Halesowen producing all the football on a superb surface delighted the large band of travelling fans.</p>
  <p>Andy Jones headed a left wing cross from Les Hines just high in the 10th minute and it was no surprise when Halesowen went on to take a 20th minute lead. Kerry Giddings won a header in the penalty box and with defender Chris Gillard hesistating, Andy Jones pounced to slot home from 10 yards out. The Yeltz then enjoyed a purple patch with Lee Collins volleying into the arms of goalkeeper Rachel in the 24th minute after Ross Collins and Matty Hall put in some great work to win a corner. The visitors were unfortunate not to increase the lead in the 26th minute when Hines put Giddings clear and he skipped past the defence before rounding goalkeeper Rachel but Craig Gaunt somehow managed to clear the firm shot off the line. Hines hit a shot just wide.</p>
  <p>Moor Green were unable to make much impression on the solid Halesowen defence in the second half and it was Jones who saw his 53rd minute header tipped over the bar by Moor Green goalkeeper Rachel. The Yeltz wrapped up the tie in the 78th minute when Giddings took advantage of a bad back-pass and as he tried to surge forward the ball broke for Hall to hit home with confidence.</p>
  <p>To complete Moor Green�s cup woes, goalkeeper Rachel was taken off injured with three minutes to go and was replaced by ex-Stourbridge stopper Andy De Bont.</p>

  <p>Halesowen were in control at Weston despite playing over half the game with only ten men after the dismissal of Leroy May. However they lacked the killer touch to turn their possession into goals.</p>
  <p>Andy Spencer volleyed over the bar early on and Halesowen went on to dominate the first half with Ross Collins also going close with an 18th minute header. May was put clear on goal in the 25th minute by Lee Collins but Weston goalkeeper Steve Weaver raced off his line to smother the final shot.</p>
  <p>The main talking point of the afternoon came in the 40th minute when referee Hannis decided to give a straight red card to Halesowen striker May for answering back.</p>
  <p>Halesowen goalkeeper Tim Clarke was rarely troubled in the first half but twice saved bravely from Weston dangerman Jimmy Cox in the second half to maintain his fifth consecutive clean sheet. But it was the visitors who continued to create the better chances with a header from Andy Jones blocked on the line by Weaver in the 53rd minute and Les Hines sending a ball across the face of goal from the resulting corner. Lee Collins then headed just wide and near the end substitute Matty Hall hit another teasing cross across the goalmouth but there was no forward to provide the final touch.</p>

  <p>Halesowen avoided slipping up in the potential banana-skin tie against &#xD;
Staveley Miners' Welfare of the Northern Counties East league and made a &#xD;
comfortable passage into the next round against Moor Green. Inevitably it &#xD;
was higher league Halesowen who piled on the pressure, although they could &#xD;
only maintain a slender lead until late on.</p>
  <p>Ross Collins and Mark Taylor sent early attempts wide before Leroy May &#xD;
latched onto a long goal kick from Tim Clarke to lob opposing goalkeeper &#xD;
Andy Hone for a 12th minute lead. However, any hope of a goal avalanche &#xD;
were denied by some determined defending from the visitors.</p>
  <p>Les Hines had a 16th minute shot from 20 yards blocked and five minutes &#xD;
later Andy Jones flicked just wide from Richard Colwell's cross. Staveley &#xD;
won a 26th minute freekick when Ross Collins gave the ball away in &#xD;
midfield, but the defensive wall held firm.</p>
  <p>Andy Jones turned and squirted another shot wide in the 28th minute and &#xD;
Ross Collins had a shot cleared off the line. Paul Sharman then bravely &#xD;
headed away a fierce Taylor shot in a packed Staveley penalty area. &#xD;
Goalkeeper Hone played his part, saving from Andy Jones in the 38th minute &#xD;
and May's overhead kick fell just wide moments before the interval.</p>
  <p>The injured May was replaced by Kerry Giddings at half-time but Halesowen &#xD;
went close again in the 51st minute when Hone saved from Jones after Les &#xD;
Hines took a quick freekick.</p>
  <p>With just one goal in it, Staveley remained in the hunt and had their best spell midway through the second half. In the 57th minute Dave Thomson &#xD;
supplied Dave Chambers with a great opportunity but his shot rolled &#xD;
agonisingly past Clarke's post.</p>
  <p>Halesowen came back strongly towards the end, forcing three successive corners in the 68th minute and causing defender Julian Morris to make two &#xD;
desperate clearances across his own goal before finally wrapping up the &#xD;
tie. Substitute Kerry Giddings, who has developed taste for scoring &#xD;
spectacular goals, bagged another by converting a Les Hines corner with an &#xD;
overhead kick in the 83rd minute. The margin was almost increased in the &#xD;
final minutes, but Welfare's defence did just enough to distract Jones as &#xD;
he raced clear and Hone went on to make another reflex save from a Lee &#xD;
Collins header.</p>

  <p>Referee: A. Hendley (Cradley Heath) Attendance: 353 Booked: None</p>
  <p>The lights went on over the Grove when Halesowen tested their new superb &#xD;
£65,000 floodlights after the 4-0 win over Rocester to move into a top &#xD;
three spot in the league table.</p>
  <p>In a surprisingly fast and furious first half, Rocester's Andy Bourne hit a &#xD;
fierce first minute shot which Tim Clarke turned away for a corner. Les &#xD;
Hines, who raced up and down the left wing tirelessly all night, then hit a &#xD;
cross over to Leroy May a minute later and Andy Spencer's 14th minute cross &#xD;
was cleared for a corner from Jason Burnham's long ball out of defence. &#xD;
Rocester played their part in a first half of open, flowing football and &#xD;
almost took a 26th minute lead when Rob Myatt's cross was headed down by &#xD;
Andy Bourne, but the ball just escaped Russell Dematteo in front of goal.</p>
  <p>Halesowen went ahead and took control of the game in the 44th minute when &#xD;
Ross Collins was fouled on the edge of the area and Les Hines struck a &#xD;
sweet free-kick directly into the top corner. Three minutes after the break &#xD;
Nick Anthony lobbed an own goal past his own goalkeeper under pressure from &#xD;
Leroy May for Halesowen's second.</p>
  <p>With Rocester's spirit broken, Halesowen created a host of second half &#xD;
chances. May's 55th minute shot was tipped away for a corner and May then &#xD;
latched onto Neil Smith's long ball in the 66th minute but steered his shot &#xD;
just wide. Ross Collins headed Halesowen's third goal in the 71st minute by &#xD;
bundling the ball over the line from another Hines corner, with Andy &#xD;
Spencer was on hand to crash the ball further into the net.</p>
  <p>Halesowen scored a tremendous fourth goal in the 84th minute when Andy &#xD;
Jones raced down the left and sent a pinpoint cross for fellow substitute &#xD;
Kerry Giddings to rush in and head home. Rocester substitute Mick Stark was &#xD;
denied a consolation a minute later when his shot struck the post.</p>

    <h3>Swindon Supermarine 0 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    Well we didn't make it easy for ourselves, but these are exactly the sort of games we need to grind out three points out of. After dominating most of the game without converting any chances, a  in the 83rd minute clinched a 1-0 victory against bottom placed Swindon Supermarine.
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Swindon Supermarine: Haines; McClusky, Bennett, Farrow, Richardson, Davis, Joyce, Jones, Fearon (Matthews 61), Toomey, Jack. Subs: Hodgkiss, Garbutt</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, R. Collins (Skidmore 84), Hall, G. Smith (May 75), Spencer (Giddings 75), Taylor, Hines</p>
  <p>Referee:  A. Newell (Bristol) Booked: None</p>
  <p>Halesowen struggled to make headway against the bottom side and had to wait until the 83rd minute for the decisive breakthrough.</p>
  <p>A dull first half saw Andy Spencer spurn the best chance in the 43rd minute when he shot directly at goalkeeper Paul Haines when a Ross Collins flick put him clear on goal.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to miss a host of chances in front of goal in the second half. Jason Burnham weaved through the Marine defence in the 55th minute but Haines saved when Ross Collins tried to place the ball in the net. Spencer drove wide on the hour and Gary Smith turned but also hit wide with Haines stranded off his line a minute later. Haines went on to make fine blocking saves from Matty Hall and Gary Smith with Halesowen increasing the pressure.</p>
  <p>Just when the game seemed to be heading for a goalless draw, substitute Leroy May met a long right wing cross with a diving header in the 83rd minute to finally beat Haines.</p>
  <p>Halesowen lived dangerously in the dying minutes with Swindon enjoying their best spell of the game. Lee Collins made an athletic clearance off the goalline from Steve Bennett's 87th minute shot with the home side claiming that the ball had crossed the line. A minute later goalkeeper Tim Clarke beat away a shot from Tony Joyce with the visiting defence caught out and Neil Matthews headed wide but Halesowen clung on for the slender victory.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Crawford, Smith, Collins(c), Burnham, Hall (James 79), Giddings, May, Spencer, Hines. Subs: Gavillet, Martin.</p>
  <p>Redditch Utd: Willetts; Mitchell, Bradley, Field(c) (Barratt 89), &#xD;
Creighton, Frost, Swann, Cartwright, Danks, Began, Colcombe. Subs: Hackett, &#xD;
Williams.</p>
  <p>Booked: Frost (34), Giddings (34), Hall (38), Field (40), Clarke (51), Bradley (69), Crawford (85), Swann (85) Referee: J. Bottomer (Chislehurst) Attendance: 478</p>
  <p>In the end the result of the game looked better than the means by which it &#xD;
was achieved - though allowances should be made for Halesowen missing five &#xD;
key players - Andy Jones, Mark Taylor, Stuart Skidmore, Ross Collins and &#xD;
Lee Knight. Hopefully, this early season disruption should start to rectify &#xD;
itself shortly.</p>
  <p>For the third time in four matches, Halesowen took an early lead within five minutes of the start when a Les Hines freekick found Leroy May and &#xD;
Neil Smith in the clear, but it was Smith's head that claimed the goal. &#xD;
Andy Spencer then hit Colwell's cross against the underside of the bar in &#xD;
the 13th minute with the visitors looking ragged.</p>
  <p>Redditch boasted ex-Halesowen assistant manager Gary Hackett on the bench - in charge due to the inexplicable absence of manager Nicky Cross. On the &#xD;
pitch Redditch also had ex-Halesowen players Neil Cartwright, Andy Bradley &#xD;
and Mark Creighton all seeking to impress against their old club.</p>
  <p>It took Halesowen until the 45th minute to increase the lead when Leroy May &#xD;
powered home a diving header from another Les Hines set-piece - this time a &#xD;
right wing corner.</p>
  <p>Many thought Halesowen would go on to record a thumping win but it was not to be and in the end the final whistle of Mr Bottomer, keen to get back &#xD;
home to Kent, strangely enough, came as somewhat of a relief.</p>
  <p>As in previous matches Halesowen collected a handful of yellow cards, but &#xD;
this time were fortunate not to have a player dismissed. The referee judged &#xD;
Tim Clarke had handled the ball out of his area in the 51st minute when &#xD;
trying to save from an on-rushing striker, but didn't carry through the &#xD;
letter of the law by making Clarke (and Halesowen) suffer the inevitable &#xD;
consequences. Indeed, it appeared Les Hines was already preparing to take &#xD;
charge in goal whilst Mr. Bottomer was delivering his punishment to Clarke. &#xD;
In the 85th minute Michael Crawford, who looked out of sorts at left back, &#xD;
tussled with Mark Swann and as they were both walking over for a lecture &#xD;
from the referee, Crawford aimed a head-butt at Swann. Even though no &#xD;
contact appeared to have been made, Crawford can consider himself lucky to &#xD;
escape with a "yellow".</p>
  <p>Redditch pulled a goal back to change the course of the game in the 58th minute when Swann volleyed home after playing a one-two with Scott &#xD;
Colcombe. From then on, the game degenerated into a scrappy affair, but &#xD;
Halesowen had just enough in hand to hold onto the three points.</p>

    <h3>Sutton Coldfield 2 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After Saturday's uplifting victory, us long suffering Yeltz fans were forced back to reality with a very disappointing 2-0 loss at last year's strugglers Sutton Coldfield. Two late goals, the second from ex-Yeltz player Mark Bellingham ended what was by all accounts a poor game on a poor pitch. This season suddenly doesn't look so attractive. Ho hum.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us down to Chippenham Town, where hopefully we can get back to winning ways.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Sutton Coldfield: Alden; Jones, Reece, Steele(c), Farmer, Bailey, &#xD;
Whitehouse, Moran, Mitchell, Bellingham, Gardner. Subs: Randall, Walker, &#xD;
Baker.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Colwell, Burnham, N. Smith, L. Collins, Gray, Hall, Giddings, May, Taylor, Crawford. Subs: Spencer, G. Smith, Hines.</p>
  <p>Referee: P.J. Keane (Wolverhampton)</p>
  <p>Halesowen received a rude wake-up call against a Sutton side who finished third bottom last term but dug deep and battled away to register an &#xD;
unlikely win thanks to two late goals.</p>
  <p>Coles Lane appears to have changed little in the eleven years that have elapsed since last hosting the Yeltz in a league game and although the &#xD;
match programme noted recent pitch improvements, the surface was still &#xD;
below what we have come to expect on our travels. Yet these are the sort of &#xD;
games where Halesowen need to turn possession and silky skills into points &#xD;
if they are to be challenging for honours next Spring.</p>
  <p>Sutton's Dominic Reece hit just over as early as the 4th minute, but very &#xD;
little was then seen of the home side in a game Halesowen should have &#xD;
wrapped up well before half-time. Leroy May headed Matty Hall's cross over &#xD;
in the 7th minute and Saturday's hero Kerry Giddings turned to bring a fine &#xD;
save out of ex-Stourbridge goalkeeper Darren Alden after 39 minutes.</p>
  <p>Alden had an entirely average season between the sticks at Stourbridge last &#xD;
term but was on tip-top form as Halesowen sought out a winner in the second &#xD;
period. Tipping over Mark Taylor's goalbound shot in the 50th minute he &#xD;
then produced another top-drawer save from Michael Gray on the hour.</p>
  <p>Tim Clarke saved well when Nathan Moran broke clear in the 54th minute, but &#xD;
with the Royals suffering injury, cramp and tiredness late on, the Yeltz &#xD;
failed to take advantage and as time went on a scoreless draw seemed the &#xD;
most likely outcome.</p>
  <p>To their credit, the Royals battled away before pouncing in the final five &#xD;
minutes as Halesowen's midfield caved in. Even so, Sutton's 86th minute &#xD;
opener was a bad goal to concede. Halesowen lost the ball deep in Sutton's &#xD;
half and a long ball forward caught out the Yeltz defence. With Clarke &#xD;
initially in two minds he came, but did not get, allowing Leon Mitchell to &#xD;
beat him to the ball and calmly slot into an open goal.</p>
  <p>Ex-Halesowen striker and Copper Mark Bellingham arrested any lingering &#xD;
Halesowen hope deep in injury time when he turned on the edge of the box &#xD;
and fired low into the bottom corner. Manager Brendan Phillips was clearly &#xD;
heard venting his frustration at his players in the centre-circle in the &#xD;
after-match warm-down.</p>

    <p>
  <p>It's several hours later now and I'm still smiling. Last year's doom and gloom has been completely swept away by a really promising performance and an excellent result - bring it on!</p>
  <p>
    Let's not get carried away though; Gresley looked a pretty poor outfit to me, even taking into account we're in the Western Division now. However, , with what must be the  - an overhead kick from the edge of the box and two top corner 25 yarders.

<h3>Match Report from Poll</h3>

  <p>Yeltz: Clarke, Skidmore, Burnham, Knight, Collins L, Smith N, Hall, Giggings, May, Taylor, Crawford; Subs: Spencer, Gray, Smith G</p>
  <p>
    I don't get out much nowadays, especially to The Grove so  kindly went through the team with me just after kickoff. Unfortunately he made a comment overheard by all the Jolly Boys that may haunt him for years - . Well he may well be proved right, but on my first view I think it's safer to avoid the wrath of the mob by disagreeing with him.
    
      <b>Argus Ada</b>
      <b>"Giddings is an excellent player but I don't think he'll score many goals"</b>
    
  </p>
  <p>It was probably the ideal start, an early goal to settle everyone's nerves and remind us of what's supposed to happen this year - we're going to win most of our games :-) Some nice passing, a cross to Giddings on the edge of the box and an overhead kick off his shin that looped over the keeper to flop into the net off the bar. Quality.</p>
  <p>I'm not sure where Gresley are going to finish this year, but I thought they were pretty poor. Their passing was inaccurate and marking awful. We defended OK when we needed to with Skiddy cancelling his holiday to play at rightback and Neil Smith playing alongside Lee Collins for most of the game after Knight had gone off in the first minute (too early for me to see) with a suspected broken collar bone. Some of our play was a bit disjointed; not surprising seeing as it's almost a completely new side from last year, but there were some excellent passing movements that bode well for the rest of the year - assuming that these players stay for longer than a few weeks :-)</p>
  <p>On with the report I suppose. Giddings' second was brilliant, running at their defence and smacking one in the corner from outside the box. Joyous celebrations followed, and even though they hit the post just before the break, everyone was in fine spirits as we hit the club shop to buy assorted rubbish at half-time.</p>
  <p>Second half contined in much the same vein, once the ref had arrived after the half-time squitters. We passed it well without creating too many chances and they came into it a bit more, but a third from Giddings pretty much clinched it. It was almost identical to his second, a piledriver from outside the box leaving the keeper helpless. As I said on the home page, I don't think there can have been many better hat-tricks at The Grove, not in my memory anyway. They nearly scored when Tim Clarke was stranded off his line but we eventually cleared it and we trooped off to celebrate the night away. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>One note of caution: no one had any ideas about a song for Mr Giddings. Does anything rhyme with his surname? This is going to take some work.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Clarke; Skidmore, Burnham, Spencer (Colwell 55), Knight (N. Smith 52), L. Collins (Knight 85), Hall, Giddings (G. Smith 73), May (Gray &#xD;
57), Carter, Hines (Crawford 80). Subs: Shaw, Garvey.</p>
  <p>Boston United: Bastock; Clifford, Lodge, R. Weatherston (Gould 49), Monington, Marsh, Brown, S. Weatherston, Murphy (Elding 75), Clare (Town &#xD;
86), Angel (Cook 66)</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Scarr (Rubery) Attendance: 207</p>
  <p>Halesowen created the first chance when Matty Hall cut through the Boston &#xD;
defence in the 2nd minute and found Alfie Carter who powered a shot at Paul &#xD;
Bastock. However, it was much-fancied Boston who made an impressive opening &#xD;
with Micky Brown striking the post in the 3rd minute before surging ahead &#xD;
with two early goals.</p>
  <p>Mark Angel beat his marker and squeezed the ball past goalkeeper Tim Clarke in the 13th minute and three minutes later the Halesowen defence were &#xD;
caught out again from Angel's right wing corner with Daryl Clare on hand to &#xD;
touch the ball home from close range.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen carved out their own clearcut chances with Hall screwing a sitter wide from ten yards when Leroy May's cross found him unmarked in &#xD;
the 22nd minute. Carter then burst through the heart of Boston's defence in &#xD;
the 34th minute but Paul Bastock saved easily when he tried to place his &#xD;
final shot.</p>
  <p>Five minutes before the break the Pilgrims notched a third goal when Clare crossed from the right for former Telford striker Gez Murphy to head home &#xD;
from close range.</p>
  <p>The Conference side appeared to drop down a gear at the start of the second period allowing Yeltz captain Lee Collins to head a free-kick from Les &#xD;
Hines inches wide in the 51st minute. Carter volleyed wide from Hall's &#xD;
cross on the hour and at the other end Clarke saved well from Clare after &#xD;
Murphy's cross. Boston were then punished in the 69th minute when Kerry &#xD;
Giddings muscled past two defenders before crashing a left foot shot from &#xD;
18 yards into the top corner of the net. Two minutes later Hines set up &#xD;
substitute Michael Gray to plant the ball beyond Bastock as Halesowen came &#xD;
storming back.</p>
  <p>Following a flurry of late substitutions, Clare was brought down in the &#xD;
82nd minute and Boston captain Mike Marsh stepped up to hit the penalty to &#xD;
the right of goalkeeper Tim Clarke to confirm their superiority.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Greg Evans</h3>

  <p>
    Halesowen :
    
      <pre>Clarke&#xD;
Colwell    Knight       Burnham    Crawford&#xD;
Hall       Skidmore     Carter      Hines&#xD;
           Giddings     Bailey</pre>
    
  </p>
  <p>Subs used: Paul Shaw, Michael Gray, Spencer, Martin</p>
  <p>A creditable draw against a Birmingham side containing Curtis Woodhouse, Kevin Poole and Paul Furlong.</p>
  <p>Bailey and Alfi Carter again stared in a good all round display. Giddings had two good first half chances producing an excellent save from Kevin Poole.&#xD;
Second half Bailey produced an excellent shimmy to round Poole only to see his shot cannon back off the post.&#xD;
The defence, without Lee Collins still looked solid and Tim Clarke was only really troubled on one&#xD;
occasion.</p>
  <p>One time Tamworth midfielder Micheal Gray came on in the second half and ex Kiddy, Walsall and Hereford forward Leroy May was also on the bench but didn't appear. Things are looking good particually if we can hold onto Dennis Bailey and Alfi Carter who would surely have too much quality for the Western Division.</p>
