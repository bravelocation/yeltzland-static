    <h3>Dorchester 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We had to win and we did. There's still a huge battle on our hands, but finally our improved performances under Brendan Phillips resulted in some points.</p>
  <p>Dorchester went down to 10 men after just after the break, but then went and took the lead in the 76th minute. Thankfully we got an equaliser not long after from  <b>Peter Sutton</b>  and then a winner from newish bloke  <b>Ricky Otto</b> , which moved us  <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=24032001"&gt;off the bottom</a> </b>  to within an achievable 7 points of safety. More details of the match as soon as I get them, or if anyone who made the trip  <a href="/news/addmatchreport.asp?date=24032001"&gt;sends in a match report</a> .</p>
  <p>There's a new vote on the site - an online version of  <b>player of the season</b> . The mailing list produced a very short shortlist, but mail me anyone else you think should be on and I'll include them. If I continue in this good mood I may even award a prize to the winning player :-)</p>
  <p>Next game is a definitely winnable trip down to long-time friends  <b>Merthyr</b>  next Saturday.  <b>Believe it. We can do it.</b> </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Dorchester Town: Ormerod; Sullivan, Harris (Diaz 80), White, Gittens, Impey, Lonnon, Oldbury (Jermyn 57), Murray, Sargent, Holmes (Groves 65)</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Crisp, Burnham, Walker, Wood, Smith, Skidmore, Ince (Crawford 72), Sutton, Bailey, Hines (Otto 72). Unused Sub: Ford</p>
  <p>Booked: Skidmore (23), Harris (33), Wood (37). Sent Off: Impey (55) Referee:  K. Johnson (Bristol) Attendance: 426</p>
  <p>Halesowen emerged as victors from their basement battle with Dorchester and prepared to go to Merthyr with renewed hope of achieving a survival miracle.</p>
  <p>The first half was a grim affair with few goal scoring opportunities and &#xD;
confirmed why both teams find themselves in trouble this season. Peter &#xD;
Sutton forced the first corner for the Yeltz in the 16th minute and three &#xD;
minutes later a cross from Richard Crisp was easily taken out by goalkeeper &#xD;
Mark Ormerod. James Ince set Peter Sutton free in the 29th minute but his &#xD;
shot was blocked. Just before the break, Dorchester made a quick break &#xD;
through Andy Sargent, but Martyn Sullivan sent a cross well over the bar. &#xD;
Sullivan then touched a freekick to Marcus Oldbury but he also hit wide. &#xD;
Halesowen goalkeeper Andy Quy suffered a knee injury at the end of the &#xD;
first period, but struggled on through the game with a disappointing &#xD;
Dorchester unable to put him under much pressure in the second half.</p>
  <p>Phil Wood and Richard Walker denied Sargent when clear on goal in the 53rd &#xD;
minute as they protected the hobbling Quy in goal. The game finally sprung &#xD;
to life in the 55th minute when Neil Smith played a long ball out of the &#xD;
Halesowen defence and Dorchester goalkeeper Ormerod missed his clearance &#xD;
under pressure from Dennis Bailey and as Bailey bore down on goal he was &#xD;
impeded by Jamie Impey. The referee gave Impey the red card and awarded a &#xD;
penalty to Halesowen but the visitors wasted the opportunity when the &#xD;
normally reliable Les Hines struck the spot-kick well wide of the &#xD;
right-hand upright.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen starting to edge the balance of play against ten-man &#xD;
Dorchester, Bailey set up Smith but he blasted over from just 8 yards out. &#xD;
Sutton then headed a cross from Stuart Skidmore into the arms of Ormerod. &#xD;
As so often this season, the visitors were made to pay in the 73rd minute &#xD;
when substitute Matt Groves hooked home a corner from Martyn Sullivan to &#xD;
take the lead with Halesowen failing to clear the danger. However, the &#xD;
Yeltz levelled within a minute with Sutton following up to score when &#xD;
Bailey's effort was blocked by Ormerod. Wood then cleared a cross from Rob &#xD;
Murray with a diving header. Halesowen held their nerve and went on to &#xD;
claim all three points with a tremendous finish by ex-Birmingham City &#xD;
forward Ricky Otto who took the ball on from a midfield pass by substitute &#xD;
Michael Crawford before calmly slotting home beyond Ormerod in the 83rd &#xD;
minute. The win meant Halesowen exchanged places with Dorchester in the &#xD;
league table.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Weymouth 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It isn't going to happen. Another loss in a game we just had to win, and despite playing reasonably well at times that's 4 losses in a row and  <b>we're deservedly bottom of the league</b> .</p>
  <p>We looked quite dangerous in the first half and we were a little unlucky to be behind - but how often have we said that recently? In the second half we never looked like getting back into it, and a late second for the visitors killed off any hopes of recovery. With Folkestone beating Dorchester  <b>we're now 10 points from safety with only 9 games left</b> .</p>
  <p> <b>Saturday brings a long trip to fellow strugglers Dorchester</b> , stoopidly still kicking off at 3pm despite the England game being on at the same time. This really is the last chance, but to be honest even if we do win it's unlikely we can get safe. Still, positive vibes and all that.</p>

    <h3>Moor Green 3 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>I could have copied one of many news items from this awful season here and it probably would have been reasonably accurate.</p>
  <p>We played pretty well, fought back from a goal down to lead 2-1 (goals from new bloke and new bloke), but still managed to lose via a late-ish penalty and a last minute winner after we'd missed a sitter.</p>
  <p>That makes it a wonderful 10 points from the last 18 games. We can still stay up, especially as we've got a relatively easy run in but I reckon we'll need at least 17 points from those last 10 games. Trouble is we've been saying similar things for weeks and the equation just gets harder and harder.</p>
  <p>Take the opportunity to do something fun this weekend - thankfully we've got no game on Saturday. Unfortunately it's more stress next Tuesday when Weymouth visit The Grove.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2001/03/10/BOTTOM-AGAIN.html">BOTTOM AGAIN</a></h2>
    <h3>Yeltz 0 King's Lynn 4</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Plenty of changes both on and off the field, but getting stuffed in a game we really had to win takes us back to the  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=10032001"&gt;bottom</a> , seven points off safety and to be honest looking all but relegated.</p>
  <p>By all accounts we started brightly and should have been ahead before letting in two goals just before half-time. Two more KL goals in the second half led to what must be  <b>our largest defeat at The Grove for years?</b>  - I'll leave that as homework for those of you who want to find that out.</p>
  <p> <b>There have been several signings this week</b>  - DJ has been providing the info (as usual) on the  <a href="/haveyoursay/mailinglist.asp"&gt;Mailing List</a> , but if you're not on that (and why not?) you can see the archives at  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/yeltzland"&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/yeltzland</a>  for all the details.</p>
  <p>There's also been big changes off the pitch - not only a new manager and assistants, but  <b>Ron Moseley has decided to step down as Chairman, to be replaced by Nigel Pitt</b> . It's unfortunate Ron felt it's time to step down, but I'm sure he'll be ably replaced by Nigel. Good Luck!</p>
  <p> <b>Tuesday takes us to Moor Green</b>  in a rearranged league game, and then we've got a free Saturday next week.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Well we worked very hard to bore the league leaders into submission and there was only one chance I can remember in the whole game. Unfortunately it fell to them, and our first game under new manager Brendan Phillips was a not too unexpected 1-0 defeat.</p>
  <p>New bloke defender (Richard Walker I presume) looked particularly solid at the back, but I can't even remember our attack having a shot.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>King's Lynn: Martini; Dakin, Clark, Lenagh, Fuff, March, Anderson, Hayes, Bush (Palmer 66), Rowland, Puttnam. Subs: McNeil, Suiter</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Crisp, Ford, Comyn, Collins (Creighton 74), Skidmore, Mason (P. Lloyd 63), Sutton, Bowen, Smith (Owen 61), Hines</p>
  <p>Booked: Rowland (90), P. Lloyd (90) Referee:  G. Capps (Kettering)</p>
  <p>Ex-Nuneaton Borough supremo Brendan Phillips takes over the Halesowen &#xD;
hot-seat from the unlucky Alan Moore who saw his improving side battle back &#xD;
for a late equaliser after appearing to be in control early on.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started brightly and it was no surprise when they took a 16th &#xD;
minute lead against a weak looking home side. Jon Ford sent a long ball &#xD;
forward from the halfway line which beat the home defence and Peter Sutton &#xD;
had the easy job of rounding goalkeeper Chuck Martini before side-footing &#xD;
into the net.</p>
  <p>However, the Yeltz allowed the Linnets back into the game with their first &#xD;
real effort on goal in the 26th minute. Andy Quy only partly punched clear &#xD;
a free-kick from the troublesome Dave Puttnam and the ball fell invitingly &#xD;
for Glen Fuff to hammer into Quy's unprotected net from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>The home side went on to take the lead four minutes into the second half &#xD;
when Puttnam's through ball beat the Halesowen rearguard and Simon Bush &#xD;
slotted home from the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen reduced to their last 10 fit squad players in the latter &#xD;
stages, King's Lynn went close with a close range flick through ex-Yeltz &#xD;
forward Lyndon Rowland and had a penalty appeal by Fuff turned down in the &#xD;
67th minute.</p>
  <p>With 12 minutes remaining, Les Hines stunned the home crowd and grabbed an &#xD;
important point for Halesowen when he curled a 20 yard free-kick into the &#xD;
top corner with goalkeeper Martini stranded on the rocks.</p>

    <h3>Havant 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A hard fought point. By all accounts it wasn't much of a game, with neither team looking much like scoring. I guess three points would have been better, but at this stage any points are better than none.  <b>We're still  bottom </b>  and with Folkestone winning at Burton we're still a long way from safety, but at least we're battling.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings the second leg of this epic road trip we're on at the moment with a long trip to the flatlands of  <b> <a href="http://www.kingslynnfc.co.uk/">King's Lynn</a> </b> . A win would be lovely, please.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Havant and Waterlooville: Nicholls; Anstey (Connolly 84), Price, Cook, Gale, Daish, Wood, Blake, O'Rourke, Leworthy, Champion (Taylor 77). Unused Sub: Wakefield</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Crisp, Ford, Comyn, W. Lloyd, Skidmore, Mason (Sutton 73), Xiourouppa (P.Lloyd 79), Bowen, Smith, Hines. Unused Sub: Creighton</p>
  <p>Booked: None Referee:  D. Miller (New Milton)</p>
  <p>Hard-working Halesowen were full value for a crucial point at in-form Havant and Waterlooville who had bagged 12 goals in winning their previous &#xD;
3 home games. Inspired by captain Neil Smith, the visitors closed down &#xD;
their hosts at every opportunity and restricted their goal-scoring &#xD;
attempts.</p>
  <p>Sam Bowen volleyed wide from a Les Hines freekick in the 4th minute for the visitors and a minute later Dean Blake blasted wide at the other end in a &#xD;
sterile first period.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's resilience continued in the second half with youngster Stuart Skidmore tenacious in midfield and Costas Xiourouppa producing some &#xD;
dangerous attacking runs. Blake managed another half-chance before Richard &#xD;
Crisp cleared Ben Price's cross off the toe of Jamie O'Rourke in the 62nd &#xD;
minute. The Yeltz then had a spell of domination and Paul Nicholls saved &#xD;
well from Bowen midway through the second half after a clever combination &#xD;
between Costas Xiourouppa and Crisp.</p>
  <p>The Hawks almost snatched a winner with the best chance of the game in the 78th minute when O'Rourke met Price's cross but his looping header &#xD;
rebounded off the inside of Andy Quy's post, allowing the Halesowen defence &#xD;
to hack clear.</p>
  <p>Halesowen introduced Peter Sutton and Paul Lloyd as late substitutes and held firm for a point in their third encouraging display in row in which &#xD;
only one goal has been conceeded.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 Salisbury 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Just like the old days. A dynamic performance from the mighty Yeltz blew Salisbury away to give us some hope (at last) of avoiding the drop.</p>
  <p>We started positively right from the start, with young Skidmore and Smithy particularly excellent in the centre of midfield. We had most of the pressure and  <b>finally took the lead</b>  when  <b>SamBo</b>  headed home from a well-flighted Crispy free-kick.</p>
  <p>Second-half was more of the same. We were passing it about well, although it was from a  <b>fantastic shot from Skidmore</b>  from 30-odd yards that we extended the lead. After a third from a  <b>deflected Bowen shot</b> , we could stop checking our watches quite so often. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Stating the obvious I know, but if we can play like that in the remaining games we can get out of the drop zone. A fantastic performance from everyone today - let's hope that gives us a much needed shot of confidence.</p>
  <p>Two more crucial away games coming up - Tuesday takes us down to  <b>Havant</b>  before another long trip on Saturday to  <b>King's Lynn</b> . Both teams are in the bottom half of  the table  so let's hope for some more points.  <b>BELIEVE! WE CAN STAY UP!</b> </p>

  <p>I guess the headline's not strictly true. We're now  <b> 4 points off the bottom </b>  as several of our relegation 'rivals' once again gained points.</p>
  <p> <b>Two goals in either half</b>  meant an easy win for Bath, who to be fair haven't lost at home in the league since we beat them last season(!). Just to make things worse - if that could be possible -  <b>Steve Pie-arce was taken off injured too</b> .</p>
  <p>I hate to think what's going to happen on Tuesday when we visit top of the table  <b>Burton</b> , before next Saturday brings  <b>Salisbury</b>  to The Grove.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bath City: Bibbo; Clode, Walker, Harrington, Towler, K.Lloyd, Tisdale, Colbourne, Fraser, Paul (Hughes 84), Allison (Gosling 78). Sub: Bodin</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Crisp, Comyn, Wood, W. Lloyd (Mason 45), Ford, Carter, Piearce (Xiourouppa 32), Bowen (Sutton 78), N. Smith, Hines.</p>
  <p>Booked: W. Lloyd (16) Referee:  M. Gooding (Bristol) Attendance: 686</p>
  <p>Bottom of the table Halesowen crashed to their worst league defeat for 10 years and were sunk by two early goals from Bath, who had previously failed to win themselves for six games.</p>
  <p>Twerton Park had been a happy hunting ground for the Yeltz in earlier &#xD;
seasons so the travelling fans had hopes of claiming some points in the &#xD;
increasingly desperate fight against relegation. Nick Carter sliced his &#xD;
shot in the 11th minute after Neil Smith set Sam Bowen free but it was &#xD;
generally a dull start in soggy conditions. Bath then raced into a two-goal &#xD;
lead with the help of sloppy Halesowen defending. In the 13th minute Mark &#xD;
Clode's cross from the right found Sam Allison with all the time and space &#xD;
in the world to calmly slot past goalkeeper Andy Quy. Five minutes later &#xD;
Phil Wood fouled Martin Paul 22 yards out and Scott Walker hammered the &#xD;
free kick directly into the top corner beyond Quy to increase the lead. Quy &#xD;
then made a fingertip save from Martin Paul on the half-hour as the home &#xD;
side poured forward.</p>
  <p>Steve Piearce limped off with a recurrence of an old hamstring injury to be &#xD;
replaced by Costas in the 32nd minute and with Bath in control an effort &#xD;
from Jimmy Fraser dipped just over the bar in the 42nd minute.&#xD;
The long suffering away fans had little to lift their gloom although Neil &#xD;
Smith reversed the one-way traffic in the 45th minute when he brought out a &#xD;
fine save from Sal Bibbo from a Nick Carter cross.</p>
  <p>Manager Alan Moore and assistant Gary Hackett rung the half-time changes by &#xD;
replacing Wayne Lloyd with wide-man Michael Mason, but could not bring &#xD;
about a change in fortunes. Paul shot at Quy in the 52nd minute following a &#xD;
poor clearance by Phil Wood and at the other end Bowen headed straight at &#xD;
Bibbo from Richard Crisp's cross after good work by Mason. However, Bath &#xD;
pulled the plug on any Halesowen revival in the 63rd minute when Walker set &#xD;
up Allison to fire home from 10 yards off the post. Costas Xiourouppa &#xD;
worked through the Bath defence in the 80th minute but Crisp's resulting &#xD;
shot was blocked. Quy then made a great fingertip save from Fraser but &#xD;
Graham Colbourne completed the agony for the ragged visitors a minute from &#xD;
the end when he flicked the ball past Quy after a cross from substitute &#xD;
Jamie Gosling. This was far from ideal preparation for the visit to league &#xD;
leaders Burton Albion on Tuesday evening.........</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Welling 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A fighting performance, but the mighty Yeltz dropped another 2 crucial points in an increasing desperate relegation battle.</p>
  <p>A first-half  <b>Lloydy</b>  goal put us into a lead we held until the 78th minute, and despite  <b>Pie-arce</b>  scoring an excellent goal from a tight angle with only 6 minutes left, we once again threw a lead and important points away. With other teams winning again (Fisher, Tamworth - for no bonus points what's the connection between those two?)  <b>we're still in  last place </b> , now 5 points from the safety zone.</p>
  <p>This week's transfer news (a very regular feature now):  <b>Nick Carter</b> , a 19 year old left midfielder has signed from Tamworth.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday sees the start of a very difficult set of games as we travel down to play  <b>Bath City</b> . Thanks to everyone who mailed me with the  updated fixture list .</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Crisp, Comyn, Wood, W. Lloyd, Ford, Carter, Piearce, Bowen, Smith, Hines. Subs: Mason, Sutton, P. Lloyd</p>
  <p>Welling: Knight; Bower, Chapman, Hone, Edwards, Budden, Riviere, Rutherford, Rowe, Harland (Glover 69), Dolby. Subs: Saunders, Farley</p>
  <p>Booked: Edwards (44), Ford (44), Crisp (48) Referee: S. Tomlinson (Farnham) Attendance: 458</p>
  <p>Despite an improved battling performance Halesowen remain bottom of the &#xD;
table and paid dearly for letting Welling equalise twice to claim a draw. &#xD;
The game once again highlights that Halesowen's plight is due to a &#xD;
miserable home record and their continual failure to hold onto winning &#xD;
positions.</p>
  <p>The visitors quickly adjusted to the muddy playing surface and Halesowen &#xD;
had an early escape when Zeke Rowe was judged to be offside when he slotted &#xD;
home after a dangerous run by Anthony Riviere in the 23rd minute. But it &#xD;
was Halesowen who took the lead in the 35th minute when Jon Ford held off &#xD;
the Welling defence before laying the ball into the path of new signing &#xD;
Nicky Carter and his low cross was turned into the net by Wayne Lloyd from &#xD;
two yards out.</p>
  <p>The high-flying Wings levelled in the 78th minute when Matt Bower struck a &#xD;
dipping shot into the roof of the net from 20 yards out. In an exciting &#xD;
ending, Halesowen regained the lead in the 84th minute through a tremendous &#xD;
individual effort by on-loan Steve Piearce who fought off three defensive &#xD;
challenges before lashing the ball past Glen Knight from an acute angle. &#xD;
However, just three minutes later Halesowen let a vital lead slip again &#xD;
when they failed to clear their lines and then backed off from Riviere who &#xD;
worked through the penalty area to beat Quy.</p>
  <p>Halesowen almost grabbed a third in a frantic injury-time goalmouth &#xD;
scramble that saw Andy Comyn and Ford miss close range efforts whilst at &#xD;
the other end Wayne Lloyd made an important last gasp tackle to prevent &#xD;
Rowe winning the game for Welling.</p>

    <h3>Folkestone 2 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Another desperate result, another poor performance and make no bones about it - we are going down.</p>
  <p>The game? We took the lead in the first half through a looping header from  <b>Ross Collins</b>  when unmarked in the box. They were as bad as us, but then unbelievably took the lead from a penalty (following a blatant push) and then a goal almost straight after. We had most of the ball afterwards, but other than some tricky runs from the excellent Costas, we never looked like equalising.</p>
  <p> <b>So how are we going to get out of this awful run?</b>  Drastic changes are needed. We've go no midfield, no organisation and unbelievably we look even worse than we were under John Chambers. As several of you have pointed out on  YeltzTalk , at least two managers have been sacked for having runs as bad as we're on now, and as far as I can see the only thing that might save us from relegation is bringing someone new in as manager who might spark some life into us. Anyway, please feel free to add your thoughts on the subject.</p>
  <p>This week's transfer news:  <b>Stuart Payne has been released</b>  and has gone to Evesham. The Gas Man always worked hard, but you never really fancied him to score. Steve Piearce's loan period is up, but it's still not clear (to me anyway) whether he'll be staying or going back to Hereford.</p>
  <p>Next week brings  <b> <a href="http://www.pvr.co.uk/wings/">Welling United</a>  to The Grove</b>  in another crucial game. Come On, Come On!</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Folkestone Invicta: Wietecha; Morris (Dryden 49), Ponsford, Larkin, Daniels, Virgo, Hogg, Chambers (Ross 55), Lawrence, Dent, S. Smith (Ayling 85)</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Crisp, Hines (Bowen 67), Wood, Lloyd, Comyn, Collins (Mason 27), Xiourouppa, Piearce, N. Smith, Ford. Sub: Sutton</p>
  <p>Booked: Xiourouppa (56) Referee:  K. Knight (Hove) Attendance: 384</p>
  <p>The lights are rapidly going out on Halesowen's 11 year reign in the Premier League following this latest reversal at the hands of fellow strugglers Folkestone. The Yeltz are now without a win in ten games, having suffered six straight defeats.</p>
  <p>The visitors started brightly but Ross Collins waited too long to shoot when in the clear in the 2nd minute and could only earn a corner. Steve &#xD;
Lawrence committed a blatant foul by bundling both the ball and Andy Quy &#xD;
over the line in the 3rd minute and the goal was disallowed. Quy then saved &#xD;
an 8th minute effort from Lawrence after Phil Wood had slipped on the heavy &#xD;
pitch. For Halesowen, Les Hines worked through the Invicta defence in the &#xD;
11th minute but his final shot went high.</p>
  <p>Halesowen took the lead in the 17th minute when a Collins header looped into the net from Steve Piearce's cross. Collins then hobbled off injured &#xD;
and without his presence Halesowen failed to build on their lead against &#xD;
poor opposition despite some tricky wing play from Michael Mason. Seven &#xD;
minutes into first-half injury time Richard Ponsford curled a 20 yard &#xD;
freekick just wide for the home side.</p>
  <p>When Folkestone key players Andy Morris and Paul Chambers withdrew early in second half through injury, the visitors looked to be heading for a vital &#xD;
victory. However, as so often this season, Halesowen then pressed the &#xD;
self-destruct button and found themselves behind within the space of a &#xD;
minute. Andy Comyn pushed James Dryden in the box in the 62nd minute and &#xD;
Richard Ponsford gladly converted from the penalty spot. Almost immediately &#xD;
Dryden put Invicta ahead when he collected Nicky Dent's right wing cross &#xD;
and turned the ball into the corner of Andy Quy's net from 15 yards out. &#xD;
Despite late Yeltz pressure, Folkestone were in no mood to relinquish their &#xD;
lead and should have added to their goal tally on the break in injury time &#xD;
but Dent chose to fire at Andy Quy rather than passing across goal to the &#xD;
unmarked substitute Jeff Ross.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Another good result - postponed has been about the best we can do recently. It's going to mean a long midweek trip later in the season, but we're bound to be in better form by then :-)</p>
  <p>More squad changes I'm afraid -  <b>Stuart Corns</b>  couldn't get to training because of travel/work stuff and the poor bloke has joined Atherstone. Also,  <b>Craig Mansell</b>  "is still working away from home and cannot train mid-week" which is the official version of why he left that everyone's sticking to.</p>
  <p> <b>The site</b>  - specifically Yeltztalk and Fantasy Island -  <b>has been experiencing a few problems recently</b> , but I think the hosting company have finally sorted things out. I can only apologise for this - if you have any problems can you  <a href="mailto:poll@yeltzland.net">mail me directly</a>  and I'll get on to them again.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday, weather permitting, we're travelling most of the way to France to meet  <a href="http://www.folkestoneinvicta.co.uk"> <b>Folkestone Invicta</b> </a>  in yet another crucial bottom of the table clash. Isn't this fun?</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Ilkeston 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's getting so desperate that I've having to make predictions of doom like that above - hoping that as my predictive powers are so bad (check out  my score in Fantasy island  if you're not convinced) it'll save us.</p>
  <p>This was another awful loss, going down to a goal just before half-time. That's only 4 points from the last 8 games, we're now in  20th place  and unless things start changing soon we really do have no chance of staying up.</p>
  <p>Next week brings a trip to  <a href="http://www.crawley-town-fc.demon.co.uk/">Crawley</a> , who are currently in 5th place but have only won one in the last seven. Well you never know :-)</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Corns (Xiourouppa 38), Hines, Owen (Ford 55), Lloyd, Collins, Cartwright, Piearce, Bowen (Sutton 72), Smith, Crisp</p>
  <p>Referee:  D. Adcock (Long Eaton) Attendance: 602</p>
  <p>With both teams enduring a troubled season, this crunch meeting promised a &#xD;
repeat of the recent history of dramatic games and goals between the two &#xD;
sides at the Lamb. The game was given added spice with Halesowen enthused &#xD;
by the return of Yeltz-hero and goal-ace Steve Piearce from Hereford Utd &#xD;
and Tamworth's Caretaker Manager Caretaker Manager Tim Steele taking charge &#xD;
for his first game following the insensitively timed dismissal of Paul &#xD;
Hendrie so soon after his brutal street attack.</p>
  <p>However, a forgettable first half of little creativity or tactical &#xD;
awareness revealed why both teams are surprise strugglers at the foot of &#xD;
the Dr Martens Premier this season and the game was only brought to life &#xD;
when Tamworth took the lead in the 22nd minute with right fullback Rob &#xD;
Warner lashing home a cross from David Foy from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>Stuart Corns picked up an early injury and after signalling to the bench &#xD;
for several minutes was finally replaced by the splendidly named new &#xD;
capture Costas Xiourouppa from Bolton Wanderers who went on to reveal some &#xD;
neat first touches. Tamworth then almost wrapped up the game when a &#xD;
speculative shot caught out Andy Quy but rebounded off his right-hand &#xD;
upright. Despite a frail looking Tamworth defence, it was nearly halftime &#xD;
before the potentially potent strike force of Sam Bowen and Piearce &#xD;
combined with Piearce sending over a right-wing cross for Bowen to head &#xD;
into the side netting from an acute angle.</p>
  <p>A sizzling second half began with Quy making an excellent point blank save &#xD;
in front of goal, before Halesowen staged a remarkable fight back. The &#xD;
injured Jason Owen was replaced by Jon Ford who was only on the field for a &#xD;
few moments before scoring two goals within four minutes. In the 61st &#xD;
minute Ford collected the ball on the edge of the penalty area and his 20 &#xD;
yard shot beat Darren Acton to creep into the corner of the net. With &#xD;
renewed self belief Halesowen went ahead when Xiourouppa cleverly took two &#xD;
defenders out of the game before laying off the ball, allowing the &#xD;
resulting cross to be powerfully headed home by Ford.</p>
  <p>However as the strong contingent of travelling fans found their voice and &#xD;
contemplated the prospect of opening up some daylight between themselves &#xD;
and Tamworth in the league table, Halesowen once again lacked the &#xD;
resilience to hold onto a vital lead and conceded another two late goals in &#xD;
this must-win game. In the 76th minute, the ball was lost cheaply on the &#xD;
right wing, and ex-Stourbridge forward Christie McKenzie whipped over a &#xD;
cross for Mark Hallam to equalise from close range. Kicking down the slope, &#xD;
the goal inspired Tamworth who pressed forward and were awarded a late &#xD;
freekick on the edge of the penalty area which Foy cracked home for the &#xD;
winner with 94 minutes showing on the stopwatch.</p>
  <p>Ominously, with half the league programme now complete, Halesowen have only &#xD;
won four games and would seem to require ten more victories to ensure &#xD;
safety in what is arguably a more difficult second part of the season. &#xD;
Individually, Halesowen would seem to have enough talent and experience in &#xD;
the current squad for the task ahead but it's not happening for them as a &#xD;
team at present and it's time for everyone to pull together and understand &#xD;
their own role in the arduous but mouth-watering task ahead.</p>

    The bad weather meant a pretty miserable year was brought to a miserable end with two postponements.

Hmmm.

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Worcester 3</h3>

  <p>Booked: Corns (65) Referee:  M. Edwards (Swandlincote) Attendance: 743</p>
  <p>Halesowen slumped into deep relegation trouble as they were unable to &#xD;
recover from giving injured-ravaged neighbours Worcester an early two-goal &#xD;
advantage.</p>
  <p>Worcester stunned the home crowd with an opening goal in the 3rd minute &#xD;
when Michael Wyatt collected a short pass from former long-term Yeltz &#xD;
servant Andy Bradley and curled a shot into the corner of the net from the &#xD;
edge of the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Home defender Andy Comyn limped off the field in the 15th minute and &#xD;
seconds later Worcester took full advantage when Wyatt put Mark Owen clear &#xD;
on goal and he was brought down by Andy Quy with the home defence caught &#xD;
napping. Leading marksman Owen then stepped up to make no mistake from the &#xD;
penalty spot.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started the second half in more determined fashion but found no &#xD;
way through the Worcester rearguard and their possession continually broke &#xD;
down in the final third of the pitch.&#xD;
Another ex-Yeltz favourite Danny McDonnell raced off his goal line to beat &#xD;
Peter Sutton to the ball in the 55th minute and then thwarted Ross Collins &#xD;
by clawing away his shot two minutes later.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes from time Worcester substitute Carl Tranter produced a super &#xD;
finish from Mark Owen to make the points safe. However, the home side &#xD;
eventually claimed an 87th minute consolation when the ex-Worcester &#xD;
maverick striker Sam Bowen slotted home from close range after a cross from &#xD;
Les Hines had caught out the visiting defence.</p>

  <p>Halesowen failed to cope with a heavily sanded pitch and were well beaten with Ian Cambridge causing the damage for his namesake team.</p>
  <p>A poor first half came to life on the half-hour when Adam Wilde finished a &#xD;
great run from midfield with a 15 yard shot that was saved by Andy Quy, &#xD;
with Phil Wood clearing for a corner. In a rare moment of danger for the &#xD;
home side Richard Crisp fired into the side netting in the 43rd minute when &#xD;
Stuart Payne's header left goalkeeper Martin Davies stranded out of his &#xD;
goal. However, within a minute Cambridge went ahead when giant striker &#xD;
Tesfaye Bramble turned two Halesowen defenders and crashed the ball into &#xD;
the net off the underside of the crossbar.</p>
  <p>Cambridge controlled the second half and it no was surprise when they &#xD;
increased their lead after 55 minutes. Richard Crisp managed to clear a &#xD;
header from Steve Wenlock off his own goal line, but as his defence &#xD;
hesitated to clear, Ian Cambridge was able to convert from close range.</p>
  <p>Quy made another fine blocking save from substitute Kevin Wilkin who broke &#xD;
clear in the 63rd minute but could only watch as dangerman Ian Cambridge &#xD;
then rattled the crossbar twice in five minutes with two identical 20 yard &#xD;
shots. Striker Cambridge turned home the third goal in the 70th minute from &#xD;
a left wing cross with the visiting defence torn apart.</p>
  <p>In the dying minutes, Neil Cartwight's shot was saved by Davies and a Ross &#xD;
Collins effort was cleared off the line as Halesowen searched for a &#xD;
consolation.</p>

  <p>Halesowen bowed out of their involvement in cup football for the season with another disappointing home result to leave them with just one home victory after 15 attempts.</p>
  <p>Peter Sutton was guilty of missing two golden one-on-one situations in the first half when he waited too long before blasting at Moor Green goalkeeper &#xD;
Andy De Bont in the 10th and 24th minute. A good build up by Moor Green's Mark Shepherd then set Jae Martin free but Andy Quy turned his effort around the post and just before the break Mark Crisp could only watch his 15 yard effort rebound off the goalpost into the safe arms of Quy.</p>
  <p>Sutton screwed another shot just wide in the 51st minute following clever &#xD;
work by Richard Crisp, Neil Smith and Stuart Corns, who enjoyed an &#xD;
impressive debut game. However, it was Moor Green who grabbed the winning &#xD;
goal in the 63rd minute when Craig Woodley was on hand to turn home a &#xD;
rebound off the post after Shepherd's shot had beaten Quy. Ross Collins &#xD;
headed home a 75th minute freekick from Les Hines but the goal was &#xD;
disallowed for an infringement by Sam Bowen and it was the visitors who &#xD;
almost increased their lead late on when Mark Crisp was denied by Quy's &#xD;
fine reflex save.</p>
