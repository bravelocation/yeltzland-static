    <h3>Yeltz 1 Merthyr 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In I guess what should be called an eventful game, the mighty Yeltz ended up with their fourth draw in as many games after a late Merthyr equaliser.</p>
  <p>
    , and was at the centre of most of the controversial incidents. He had a running battle with their tiny number 7 which resulted in at least a couple of punches being swapped (although the ref didn't remember this was a sending-off offence); he managed to incite the Merthyr fans by throwing the ball at them (although I'm assuming he was provoked); he also got the faintest of touches on a Les Hines free kick in the second-half for our goal. I like him.
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Greg Evans</h3>

  <p>Eventful game. Another draw, another lost lead and another shocking referee.</p>
  <p>Team: Quy, Comyn, Owen, Wood, Lloyd (Crisp), Collins, Smith, Cartwright (Ford), Hines, Bowen (Sutton), Payne</p>
  <p>The 'star' of the show was undoubtedly the referee. He began brightly by disallowing a stunning Merthyr free kick inside 10 minutes. Both sides were baffled by decision after decision, culminating in Stuart Payne being tripped on the edge of the six yard box when about to pull the trigger. Penalty? No chance! Minutes later a punched clearance by a Merthyr defender was also missed.</p>
  <p>Debutante Sam Bowen opened the scoring against his former club, getting the faintest of touches to an inswinging free kick. Merthyr equalised against the run of play five minutes from time. More points thrown away.</p>
  <p>Bowen made an impressive debut, physical and threatening throughout. Merthyr were very physical and often ill disciplined. Bowen twice found himself on the wrong end of Welsh right hooks.</p>
  <p>But one can't help thinking that four drawn home games in which we've lost leads could prove costly come May.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Welling United: Knight; Chapman, Farley, Hone, Watts, Budden (Saunders 67), Riviere, Whitmarsh (Side 82), Canoville, Rowe, Glover. Unused Sub: Porter</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Comyn, Owen (Ford 82), Wood, W. Lloyd, Collins, Cartwright (Crisp 74), Sutton, Payne, Smith, Hines. Unused Sub: P. Lloyd</p>
  <p>Booked: Cartwright (49), Owen (69), Hone (80), Saunders (81) Referee:  J. Bottomer (Chislehurst)</p>
  <p>Halesowen had rising star Ross Collins to thank for claiming a late point at their first ever meeting at ex-Conference outfit Welling despite controlling most of an exciting end-to-end encounter.</p>
  <p>The visitors had the better of a goal-less first half with Welling goalkeeper Glen Knight saving well from Les Hines in the 10th minute and Neil Cartwright in the 16th minute. As Welling gradually came into the game, Wayne Lloyd cleared the danger in the 24th minute by heading Dean Canoville's cross over his own bar. Andy Quy then gathered a 20 yard effort from Canoville just before the interval.</p>
  <p>Stuart Payne put the Yeltz ahead in the 64th minute when he inadvertently blocked a shot from Wayne Lloyd but he was able to latch onto the rebounding ball to beat Knight from close range.&#xD;
Halesowen then had several chances to increase their lead with Knight tipping a 25 yard effort from Les Hines over the bar and Peter Sutton blasting wide after the ball was laid into his path by Hines.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen then suffered a mini-collapse and found themselves trailing within the space of a minute. Quy could only parry a long drive from Lew Watts in the 70th minute and Zeke Rowe pounced to convert the rebound. Straight from the kick-off Welling scored again when Simon Glover's left wing cross was thumped home by Anthony Riviere. To their credit, Halesowen regrouped and were rewarded with a deserved equaliser three minutes from time when in-form Collins drove home from the edge of the box following more good work by Les Hines.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bromsgrove Rovers: Gabbidon; Southwick (Beard 59), Ulfig, Townsend, Frost, &#xD;
Turpin, Benbow, Burgess, Pountney, Burrow, Biddle (Cameron 87). Subs: &#xD;
Philpot</p>

  <p>Phil Wood was serving a one-match suspension, so there was just one change &#xD;
to Saturday's line-up and it resulted in another satisfying clean sheet &#xD;
victory for Halesowen on a chilly Bromsgrove evening.</p>
  <p>Bromsgrove were keen to start putting their off-the-pitch troubles behind &#xD;
them but failed to deliver in front of goal. Andy Quy saved well from &#xD;
Richard Burgess in the 34th minute and Mark Benbow headed the following &#xD;
corner over when well placed. Quy then saved well at Craig Pountney's feet &#xD;
before Halesowen tied up the game in a two-minute spell just on half-time. &#xD;
Jason Owen saw a dipping shot turned away for a corner by Nore Gabbidon and &#xD;
although the corner was cleared, Ross Collins drove the ball into the &#xD;
corner of the net. With Collins growing in stature with each game, he made &#xD;
it 2-0 in first half injury time by heading home a Les Hines corner.</p>
  <p>Bromsgrove huffed and puffed in the second half without really creating &#xD;
much danger and it was Halesowen who should have increased their lead as &#xD;
they broke away on several occasions down the slope. Stuart Payne and Peter &#xD;
Sutton both missed opportunities with Hines also going close. Substitutes &#xD;
Ian Aldridge and Mark Williams then combined only to see Gabbidon produce a &#xD;
fine save five minutes from full time.</p>

  <p>It may have been flooding in other parts of the UK, but the Shed confirmed &#xD;
that there was a "bright golden haze on the meadow" at The Grove. Indeed, &#xD;
"the corn was as high as an elephant's eye" by 4:45pm as hearty Halesowen &#xD;
notched their first home win of the season and skipped above Tamworth and &#xD;
out of the bottom four.</p>
  <p>In the 13th minute, a Rob Warner corner was clawed away by Andy Quy who &#xD;
then saved Richard Clark's follow-up header. The Yeltz took the lead in the &#xD;
16th when a defensive clearance fell to the inspirational Ross Collins who &#xD;
cracked a 25 yard volley into the corner of the net leaving Darren Acton &#xD;
rooted to his goal-line spot in the Tamworth goal. As Halesowen's &#xD;
confidence built, Neil Cartwright broke quickly from Tamworth's 27th. &#xD;
minute corner and fed Peter Sutton who curled a shot just over. Cartwright &#xD;
supplied Sutton again seven minutes later but he could only shoot weakly at &#xD;
Acton.</p>
  <p>A generally disappointing Tamworth looked more lively in the second period &#xD;
and Halesowen had an early escape when Quy pushed away Nicky Carter's cross &#xD;
with Mark Turner unable to use the rebound. Turner then saw his effort &#xD;
turned around the post three minutes later as the Lambs searched for an &#xD;
equaliser. At the other end, Sutton turned well in the 63rd minute but &#xD;
blasted his effort over the goal. In the 71st minute substitute Christie &#xD;
McKenzie tricked his way through the home defence and set up former Yeltz &#xD;
boy Nick Colley, but his shot drifted across the face of goal. Cartwright &#xD;
scuffed a 76th minute effort but as tension rose around the ground, it was &#xD;
left to the Halesowen rearguard, marshalled by man-of-the-match Phil Wood, &#xD;
to secure the vital three points. Ten minutes from time Carter saw a 25 &#xD;
yard drive go agonisingly wide and then two minutes from time a shot from &#xD;
Houghton whipped across goal, but by the final whistle the Yeltz were &#xD;
confidently stroking the ball around down the other end.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Another cup, another disappointing defeat.</p>
  <p>I know I'm ridiculously positive at times, but I can't remember things looking so grim. We're not quite out of all the cups (thanks for everyone who reminded me about next week's League Cup game at Bromsgrove), and if Fisher had won tonight - their game was thankfully called off - we would have been bottom of the league. The worst of it is, the way we've played in the last few games shows it isn't really a false position.</p>
  <p>We've got a couple of home games coming up - starting with Tamworth on Saturday - so let's hope we can get something going. So what if we haven't won a game at Fortress Grove since April, this would be a great time to break that streak.</p>

    <h3>FAT  Yeltz 1 Bilston 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In a completely depressing performance, the mighty Yeltz failed to take any steps along the road to wherever the final's going to be this year.</p>
  <p>
    We were  and outclassed  who are currently top of the Midland and West Division. I can't remember their keeper making a single save, with our only threat coming from  who scored a screamer from 20-odd yards and hit the bar with a lob from about 40.
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from James Pearson</h3>

  <p>In a hopeful mood I took a camera to the Bilston game expecting to take&#xD;
a few pictures of our strikeforce in action - I'd have been better off&#xD;
trying to catch a train in York at the moment. Jason's two strikes of&#xD;
brilliance (OK so one clipped the bar but at least one went in were too&#xD;
quick for me - unlike the multitude of Bilston attempts).</p>
  <p>I can't remember when there was such an absence of hope on both the pitch&#xD;
and amongst the crowd - I've seen more lively wakes! To criticise&#xD;
specific players is just taking easy pot shots - anyone who was there&#xD;
could write a book on the subject. With the exception of a brilliant&#xD;
display in goal (if you overlook positioning for their first goal) and&#xD;
Jason's performance there was a dirth of skill and effort. Collins at&#xD;
least tried but after his first half booking for a clumsy challenge&#xD;
looked restained, but in all fairness he was at the mercy of an&#xD;
unpredictable and whistle happy referee.</p>
  <p>I agree that we should always aim to get behind the players, but that is&#xD;
so hard when there is so little feedback from the performance on the&#xD;
pitch. While we all recognise that there are playing shortfalls in the&#xD;
current side they can be forgiven to an extent if those of us who pay&#xD;
over our money at the turnstiles can at least see the players trying.&#xD;
Effort is no substitute for skill and ability but, recognising the&#xD;
financial restrictions of the club, those of us who are realistic fans&#xD;
realise that the side cannot be shoffled like at deck of cards at the&#xD;
whim of the crowd or the manager. Given that, do not leave the dwindling&#xD;
few who are enduring this ongoing heartache whithout the crumb of&#xD;
comfort that effort would give us.</p>
  <p>To a degree I feel sorry for Scot Darroch. He appears like a fish out of&#xD;
water and stands out and the weakest link in a poor side. Having said&#xD;
that he is a youngster who needs compaetitive football to improve his&#xD;
skills. In a committed, enthusiastic team his odd errors could be&#xD;
compensated for and his abilities could develop. I am not saying he is&#xD;
the saviour of the side but he is just an example of the malaise within&#xD;
the side.</p>
  <p>The people who come to watch the side do not want to be critical. OK I&#xD;
am excluding the moaning few who have always been there and complained&#xD;
that the Joinsons were too slow and Sean Flynn should go back to&#xD;
bricklaying. We want to get behind the side but it is a two way thing.&#xD;
When the side give us a moment to cheer the volume increases, that rubs&#xD;
off on the players and the cycle begins. We are crying out to be&#xD;
inspired but at the moment there is more life in a Balti Chicken Pie&#xD;
than on the pitch. We want to enjoy going to the Grove, we want to cheer&#xD;
the players, we want to look forward to a Saturday afternoon - but at&#xD;
the moment is anyone, honestly, looking forward to next Saturday,&#xD;
without a feeling of dread in the pit of their stomach?</p>
  <p>Next Saturday I will drive to the game with a sense of optomism, the&#xD;
sickening feeling of yeasterday afternoon will have become a distant&#xD;
memory. Don't allow those memories to come back - try and you will be&#xD;
supported. In all of this I have not mentioned the management of the&#xD;
club. It was a difficult time to take charge of the club and funds must&#xD;
be limited, however if you give us passion and spirit those watching can&#xD;
forgive and look to future. Is is really too much to expect?</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Dorchester 1</h3>

    Well we still haven't won at "Fortress" Grove this season, and only just scraped a point against Dorchester through a late Wayne Lloyd goal. Full details in the .

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Hines, Owen, Wood, Lloyd, Comyn, Ford, Cartwright &#xD;
(Mason 75), Payne (Aldridge 67), Sutton, Darroch (Collins 60).</p>
  <p>Dorchester Town: Ormerod; Sullivan, Keeler, White, McIvor, Harris, Lonnon, &#xD;
Jermyn, O'Hagan, Pickard, Holmes. Subs: Groves, Radcliffe, Cannie.</p>
  <p>Booked: None Referee:  M. Williams (Hereford) Attendance: 417</p>
  <p>As Halesowen searched for their first home win of the season, Dorchester &#xD;
seventh goalkeeper of the season Mark Ormerod had to race out of his goal &#xD;
twice within the first ten minutes but on both occasions he was beaten to &#xD;
the ball by striker Stuart Payne who was then unable to find the net. &#xD;
Ormerod then snatched the ball away from fellow striker Peter Sutton on the &#xD;
edge of his box as Halesowen again broke through in the 15th minute. At the &#xD;
other end, Dorchester man of the match Justin Keeler fired just over the &#xD;
bar after cleverly taking down Owen Pickard's pass in the 21st minute. In a &#xD;
scrappy first half, Ormerod was again on hand again to block a 28th minute &#xD;
effort from Payne who was put clear on goal by Sutton and Halesowen's &#xD;
goalkeeper Andy Quy turned away a 25 yard curling effort from Matt Lennon &#xD;
just before the break.</p>
  <p>The stalemate was finally broken in the 58th minute when Keeler waltzed &#xD;
through the home defence and the ball eventually fell invitingly for Matty &#xD;
Holmes to turn home from 8 yards beyond Quy. Halesowen introduced three &#xD;
late substitutes as they searched for an equaliser and it was Ross Collins &#xD;
who caused most trouble. Firstly he had a 76th minute effort disallowed for &#xD;
offside and then produced a tremendous right wing cross in the 86th minute &#xD;
but neither Ian Aldridge nor Michael Mason could produce the finishing &#xD;
touch. One minute later Halesowen equalised when defender Wayne Lloyd rose &#xD;
above everyone to power home a header from substitute Michael Mason's &#xD;
corner, leaving Dorchester to survive a last minute onslaught and share the &#xD;
points.</p>
  <p>In a final twist, it was later discovered that the travelling Dorchester &#xD;
fans managed to leave their huge Union Jack Dorchester flag at The Grove. &#xD;
Further developments involving a possible ransom demand for the return of &#xD;
the flag (Enigma machine style) can be expected.</p>

    It was announced before the kick-off that . The two wins last week had obviously helped his case, but predictably we then went and lost to previously winless Fisher. Inspired.

<h3>Match Report from Dave Johnson</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Hines, Owen (Payne 45), Wood, Lloyd, Comyn, Collins, &#xD;
Cartwright (Ford 68), Griffiths (Hodgetts 71), Mason, Darroch</p>
  <p>Fisher Athletic: Munden; Powell, O'Neil, Manning, Taylor, Newson, Gamble, &#xD;
Tydeman, Overton, Huggins (Best 68), Barr (Adams 82). Unused Sub: Eagle</p>
  <p>Booked: None Referee:  K. Woolmer (Northampton) Attendance: 413</p>
  <p>Halesowen unveiled Alan Moore as their new manager just before the kick-off &#xD;
but then produced an embarrassingly weak performance to hand no-hopers &#xD;
Fisher their first win of the season.</p>
  <p>The Londoners took the lead on the half-hour when livewire striker Leroy &#xD;
Huggins controlled a long ball from defence before thumping a 15 yard drive &#xD;
past Andy Quy. Quy then punched clear from under his own bar when Hamad &#xD;
Barr delivered a troublesome corner. For Halesowen, Scott Darroch worked &#xD;
hard and sent two efforts wide of goal but it wasn't until the 58th minute &#xD;
that Fisher were troubled when a Ross Collins header was scrambled off the &#xD;
line by goalkeeper Maurice Munden.</p>
  <p>Fisher increased their lead in the 65th minute as Huggins took advantage of &#xD;
another long ball to finish clinically from 10 yards. Substitute Lionel &#xD;
Best then almost made it three with his first touch at the far post. Stuart &#xD;
Payne had a 78th minute header disallowed for offside and substitute Andy &#xD;
Hodgetts missed two late chances but in fairness Halesowen were lightweight &#xD;
in attack and will need to take a long hard look at themselves and how they &#xD;
can move on from here</p>

    Things are definitely looking a bit brighter. A second win on the trot, this time through a late Wayne Lloyd winner against 10 man Stafford. We're still only in , but at least we're not tailed off the bottom any more.

    <h3>Clevedon 1 Yeltz 4</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    It's been a long time coming but the mighty Yeltz finally registered their first win, stuffing Clevedon 4-1. Two pens from Les Hines, and first goals from Darroch and Mason means we've snuck up to .

<h3>Match Report from Dave Johnson</h3>

  <p>Clevedon Town: Hervin; Rollo, Haines, Peters, Coupe (Skidmore 75), Harvey, &#xD;
R.Ford, Badman, Mehew, Mainwaring, Lester. Subs: Llewellyn, Jeffries</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Hines, Owen, Wood, Lloyd, Comyn, Collins (Cartwright &#xD;
64), J. Ford, Payne (Mason 85), Griffiths (Hodgetts 81), Darroch</p>
  <p>Booked: Owen Referee:  R. Desmond (Swindon) Attendance: 303</p>
  <p>Caretaker manager Alan Moore led Halesowen to their first win of the season &#xD;
at the 8th attempt with the help of two penalties strikes as Halesowen &#xD;
finally put their start of season nightmare behind them.</p>
  <p>However, only 303 were there to witness it - some vague excuses about &#xD;
nuptuals I believe and also the Somerset shortage of fuel at a ground &#xD;
demanding car travel as it's in the middle of nowhere with few houses &#xD;
nearby. However, those that made it will now doubt annoy everyone by saying &#xD;
"where we you when the Yeltz won their first match of the season?". Before &#xD;
I forget, here's a brief stat attack - Scott Darroch's goal was the 700th &#xD;
for the Yeltz in ten and a bit seasons in the Southern Premier.</p>
  <p>The visitors made an ideal start when Iain Harvey tripped Stuart Payne and &#xD;
Les Hines stepped up to score from the resulting penalty in the 9th minute. &#xD;
Jon Ford then drove just wide for the Yeltz in the 17th minute. Clevedon &#xD;
levelled with their first strike on goal in the 23rd minute when Danny &#xD;
Haines cracked home directly from a 25 yard freekick giving Andy Quy no &#xD;
chance. David Mehew struck the side-netting with a glancing header three &#xD;
minutes later from Richard Ford's freekick, but Halesowen regained the lead &#xD;
and control in first half stoppage time when Scott Darroch thundered an 18 &#xD;
yard volley into the angle of the net, taking advantage of Harvey's poor &#xD;
clearance. It was Darroch's first for Halesowen and a memorable strike to &#xD;
register the 700th goal in the Southern Premier for the Yeltz.</p>
  <p>Clevedon were briefly excited in the 50th minute when Richard Ford had a &#xD;
goal disallowed for offside - the flag had been raised several seconds &#xD;
earlier, though the referee hadn't noticed. Jason Owen was then booked for &#xD;
dissent. Quy produced a fine save from Richard Ford in the 56th minute but &#xD;
then in a repeat of the first half, Harvey brought down Payne who had made &#xD;
a great right wing run and Hines again crashed home from the penalty spot &#xD;
to increase Halesowen's lead.</p>
  <p>At 3-1 and the clock ticking horrid visions of Crawley briefly came back as &#xD;
the Yeltz conceeded midfield and gave away the ball cheaply on the edge of &#xD;
their box. However, the brief storm was easily weathered and with the help &#xD;
of substitutions Halesowen went on to record a much deserved win. &#xD;
Ex-Macclesfield man Michael Mason stepped off the substitute's bench to &#xD;
notch Halesowen's fourth in injury time after tricking his way past two &#xD;
defenders and curling the ball beyond Mark Hervin to make Halesowen's &#xD;
victory a comprehensive one.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Crawley 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We were 2-0 up, only 5 minutes were left and Crawley were down to 10 men - surely we must get our first win of the season?</p>
  <p>
    I can't remember a more devastating end to a game. We hadn't really played that well, but three points would have really boosted our confidence and turned the whole season around. Now we're desparately awaiting a new manager to get things going. Anyway, I'll try and summarise what happened in an unbelievably eventful game in my .

<h3>Match Report from Poll</h3>

  <p>To be honest, it's a day later and I'm still a bit in shock. 2-0 up AND the ref an ex-Halesowen player, you've got to fancy your chances.</p>
  <p>The team selection seemed a bit mad to me, but after our last few results I guess you'll try anything. We had hundreds of defenders playing and Les Hines on the right, but I guess it all worked out pretty well. First half was about even - well not a lot happened, except for one amazing incident where after some desparate Yeltz defending the ball ricocheted of the consistently brilliant Mr. Crossbar at about 200 mph.</p>
  <p>The second half was completely mental. First daft thing was their defender punching the ball out and hoping no-one would notice. They spent ages arguing, but he had to go and Les Hines knocked in the pen. Next up, Ross Collins brought down a cross with perfect control and smacked it in the corner. The only flaw in what was a fantastic goal was that he'd obviously used his arm to bring it down. Mr. Scarr must have had something in his blue and white contact lenses as he was the only person on the ground (I suppose the linesmen too?) who didn't see it. Good work.</p>
  <p>I think DJ said it was 86 minutes when they got one back, but surely with the extra man all we had to do was keep the ball? I'm hoping it was just a lack of confidence that caused us to panic as we went completely to pieces, started hacking it anywhere, and then were devastated when they somehow managed an equaliser right at the end. Not surprisingly they went completely doolahly and we consolidated our 21st place in the table. It were the worst.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Burton 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Well the manager left and not much changed. Another poor performance, another loss and we're only kept off the bottom of the table on goal difference.</p>
  <p>All the goals came in the second half, with ours a late so-called consolation scored by Mr. O'Goal. By all accounts they were all over us for much of the game. Very, very depressing.</p>
  <p>
    It's the shareholders' meeting on Friday, which should prove quite interesting. As I'm one of the select few, I'll be attending so if anyone's got any (sensible) suggestions for questions  and I'll try and get an answer. Full report on proceedings next week.
