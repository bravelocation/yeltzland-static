    <h3>Yeltz 1 Gloucester 0 and Yeltz 2 Bath City 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Two narrow victories at The Grove over the holiday period meant the mighty Yeltz go into 2006 in a little better spirits (let's not go overboard here). A 1-0 win over Gloucester was followed by a 2-1 defeat of Bath City - and yes I was there for the Bath game (and I even saw Howard's very early goal!). Full details as ever in Dave's match reports.</p>
  <p>We complete our holiday fixtures today (Monday) when we travel to Merthyr. It's important we keep our good run going if we are going to keep our promotion hopes realistic. We won there last year but it's always a tough place to visit and they're in decent form so a point would be reasonable I reckon.</p>
  <p>I'm back from my travels now so the site should be back to normal service - let's hope for a successful 2006!</p>

    <h2><a href="/2005/12/20/OUT%20AGAIN.html">OUT AGAIN</a></h2>
    <h3>EC  Banbury 2 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Our disappointing run continues with a 2-1 defeat at Banbury in the Errea (League) Cup. After taking the lead through Fozzy, we went behind to two second half goals and couldn't come back. Ho Hum.</p>
  <p>The holiday period gives us two home games to get the season back on track - Gloucester are the visitors on the 27th before we host Bath City on New Years Eve. We're down to  14th in the table  after the latest results, which is both 10 points below the playoff spots and 5 points above the relegation zone.</p>
  <p>Anyhoo, Merry Xmas to all of you out there and lets hope for a happy, prosperous and successful 2006. I'm on my travels over the next few days so the site won't be updated much, and hopefully I'll see many of you at the Bath game where I will break my 2005 jinx!</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Banbury United: Tricker; Robinson, Kinch, Sullivan, Redknap, Fuller, Stanbridge, Lamb, Blossom (McKay 78), Baird, Gooderick (Nicholls 90). Unused Subs: Jackson, Foster</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Gayle; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pierpoint, Knight, N. Smith (Drakeley 32), C. Smith (Cowley 87), Forinton, Skidmore, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Bowater, Amos</p>
  <p>Referee: W. Ramsay (Coventry)     Attendance: 155</p>
  <p>Halesowen crashed out of a second cup competition within four days as two second-half goals saw them defeated at the first hurdle in the Southern League Cup. The defeat ended a 40 year-old unbeaten sequence of fifteen games against the Puritans.</p>
  <p>Tamworth goalkeeping coach Mark Gayle was drafted in and Aaron Drakeley from tenants Causeway United also made his debut with Nicki Preston taking on the captain's arm-band.</p>
  <p>The much-changed Yeltz started brightly and took the lead on 4 minutes when Stuart Pierpoint's right-wing cross was nodded home by Simon FORSDICK from close range.</p>
  <p>Stuart Skidmore could have doubled the Halesowen lead in the 18th minute by heading straight at goalkeeper Simon Tricker after a flowing move involving Howard Forinton and Pierpoint. The in-form home side, with just one defeat in their last eleven games, rarely threatened in a first-half which saw Yeltz midfielder Nick Smith stretchered off with a knee injury.</p>
  <p>After a scrappy opening to the second period that saw the referee also leave the pitch injured, Halesowen wasted a 63rd minute free-kick with Pierpoint putting the ball wide after Tricker escaped a caution by handling the ball outside his penalty area.</p>
  <p>Banbury levelled on 66 minutes when Andy Baird's driving run ended with him finding Ollie STANBRIDGE in the box and the winger placed his angled shot past a diving Mark Gayle into the bottom left-hand corner.</p>
  <p>The tie was settled seven minutes later with a wonder strike from Wayne BLOSSOM. An Adrian Fuller free-kick was only partially cleared by the Halesowen defence and the ball bounced for the striker to score with an audacious overhead kick.</p>
  <p>Banbury could have extended their lead with Blossom hitting the post and Baird forcing an excellent save from Gayle. Les Robinson also played an 82nd minute through ball for Baird to lob just over the bar. But Halesowen applied pressure in the nine minutes of injury time and almost forced extra-time when Ian Cooper's 30-yard shot bounced off the crossbar with Forsdick blazing the rebound high.</p>

    <h3>FAT 1R  Yeltz 1 Tamworth 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Maybe a bit harsh, but an excellent battling Yeltz performance was marred by a strange goal that looked very dodgy from 80 yards away through blue contact lenses. It's a shame the referee spolit what was an excellent cup tie, and one that we probably deserved to get at least a draw. A more considered view - including quotes from the two managers - from Dave in his  match report  :-)</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we play our last game before Xmas in the Errea Cup (the League Cup) at Banbury. The winner will be decided on the night, and will be at home to Rushall in the last 16, so we've got half a chance of having a decent run.</p>
  <p>BTW in case you were wondering it's definitely not me who is the jinx as I was on the phone to Frank when they equalised, so that makes it definitely him. Thankfully I won't be at a game until New Year's Eve so the theory can't be tested any more.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; I. Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope (Pierpoint 72), Knight, Cowley (N. Smith 67), Lamey, Forinton, Amos, Forsdick. Unused Subs: C. Smith, Skidmore, Johnson.</p>
  <p>Tamworth: Bevan, A. Smith, Bampton, Melton, Motteram (Turner 85), Ward, Storer, Jackson (Francis 66), Edwards, Neilson, Anaclet. Unused Subs: M. Cooper, Gayle (GK), Tuohy</p>
  <p>Referee: R. L. Lewis (Shrewsbury)  Attendance: 668 Booked: Edwards (21), Bampton (49), Forinton (76), Amos (77), Lamey (81), Haywood (83), Pierpoint (90), N. Smith (90).</p>
  <p>Sponsors' Man of the Match: Howard Forinton   NLP Man of the Match: Alex Cowley</p>
  <p>Halesowen took an early lead but were denied a deserved replay and bowed out of the Trophy when Nationwide Conference Tamworth poked home a controversial, sloppy late winner.</p>
  <p>Manager Paul Holleran claimed that "Dean Coleman had both hands on the ball and Eddie Anaclet got away with a cheeky toe-poke" as he highlighted a number of refereeing decisions against the Yeltz. In contrast, opposing manager Mark Cooper felt that "Coleman spilled the ball before Anaclet tapped home".</p>
  <p>The lower league Yeltz were far from over-awed and made a fine start as tricky winger Alex Cowley bamboozled three defenders down the right in the 6th minute only for Simon Forsdick to mis-hit the resulting cross.</p>
  <p>FA Cup giant-killers Tamworth were given a shock taste of their own medicine in the 7th minute when an excellent flick from Howard Forinton set Nathan LAMEY free and he ran on 35 yards, holding off two chasing defenders before beating Scott Bevan with a fine finish from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>But Halesowen's lead was short-lived as the Lambs levelled just two minutes later when Graham WARD curled a direct free-kick past the defensive wall beyond static goalkeeper Coleman into the corner of the net after Gary Knight needlessly fouled Nathan Jackson on the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>Nick Amos then headed Dave Haywood's 13th minute free-kick wide and giant goalkeeper Bevan lost Cowley's 20th minute cross but Bevan recovered to collect a 25-yard shot from Forinton seconds later.</p>
  <p>Jake Edwards received the first of the afternoon's many bookings for a nasty 21st minute elbow on Nicki Preston from referee Mr Lewis, who famously ran the line at Old Trafford last season when Spurs were denied what appeared a clear 'goal'.</p>
  <p>With Matt Redmile and Carl Heggs suspended, Tamworth gave a debut to new signing Alan Neilson, formerly of Newcastle United and in a good spell for the visitors, Forsdick cleared Jackson's 27th minute cross at the second attempt. Two minutes later Halesowen had another let-off when young Coleman failed to communicate with his defence but the ball trickled just past the post. Steve Melton's drive on the half-hour was deflected wide and four minutes later hesitant Coleman allowed Dave Bampton to head Carl Motteram's cross wide.</p>
  <p>Just before the interval Halesowen broke away with Forsdick setting Cowley free but Bevan was down quickly to save the 15-yard shot. Cowley then challenged in midfield and the ball fell kindly to Lamey, but he dragged a shot wide from the edge of the area with Forinton available in support.</p>
  <p>The hosts continued to compete well in a hard-fought second-half. Cowley's 49th minute free-kick was turned away with Bevan easily gathering Forinton's header from the resulting corner.  Bevan then punched clear from Nick Amos with Steve Pope just unable to connect with the rebound under pressure. A clever 55th minute move saw Forsdick play a return pass to Forinton but his shot was blocked for a corner and Cowley delivered a delightful free-kick into the Tamworth penalty area after 63 minutes but the ball was again hacked clear.</p>
  <p>Melton did hit the net for Tamworth in the 65th minute but his effort was disallowed for a push on Pope. Cowley limped off after 67 minutes and a minute later Coleman dithered once more but the ball was put away for a corner. Pope also limped out of the action with Preston taking over the captain's arm-band on 72 minutes.</p>
  <p>A remarkable total of six yellow cards were dished out to Halesowen in the final fifteen minutes, almost certainly leading to a disciplinary fine. With a replay looking on the cards, a good afternoon's work from Halesowen then also went wrong with Tamworth's costly, soft, late winner.</p>
  <p>An 80th minute right-wing cross went over Knight but bounced back harmlessly off substitute Stuart Pierpoint's shin to Coleman, yet the ball then inexplicably ended up in the Halesowen net. Some called it a goal-keeping gaffe with the ball slipping from Coleman's grasp, while others were looking for a free-kick against Eddie Anaclet for kicking the ball from the goalkeeper's hands. In reality, although Coleman initially had the ball under control with both hands, on-loan Southampton wide-man Eddie ANACLET took his chance to nip in and poke the ball home with Coleman failing to lay sufficient claim to a ball that slipped from his fingers.</p>
  <p>Three minutes from full-time Coleman make a splendid reflex save to deny Anaclet again with the ball rolling just past the post.</p>

    <h3>WSC 2R  Kidderminster 1 Yeltz 2 (aet)</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz gained a morale boosting if tiring victory over Kiddy in the WSC, when we came from behind to gain a late extra time victory. Despite going behind at half-time, The Pope managed to equalise from the spot before Nathan gained what sounds like a well-deserved very late winner. Full details in  Dave's match report .</p>
  <p>So on to Saturday when Tamworth visit The Grove in an exciting FA Trophy 1st Round tie. We all know they've gone up in the world recently (and we've gone down a bit too), but I still can't help thinking we've got a good chance. Let's hope so anyway!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Kidderminster Harriers: Danby (Harper 91); Graves, Ludlow, Hurren, McHale, Byrne, Wilson, Manning (Davis 102), Butler, Sheldon, Eaton (Facey 79). Unused Subs: Dawson, Meyrick.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Johnson, Haywood, Pierpoint, Pope, Skidmore, N. Smith (Amos HT), C. Smith (Lamey 86), Forinton, Cooper, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Cowley, Preston.</p>
  <p>Referee: J. Cox (Evesham)  Attendance: 269 Booked: Ludlow (15), Skidmore (54), Pope (97)</p>
  <p>Worcestershire Senior Cup holders Halesowen recovered from a half-time deficit to win through in extra-time with a storming finish.</p>
  <p>Unlucky Simon Forsdick struck the woodwork three times and had another good effort cleared off the line before substitute Nathan Lamey joined the late party by also striking the post before notching a deserved extra-time winner.</p>
  <p>Kidderminster elected to name five players with first team experience this term under the stewardship of caretaker-manager Martin O'Connor and the youngsters had much the better of the first half.</p>
  <p>Gareth Sheldon returned from recent injury to shoot at Halesowen goalkeeper Dean Coleman in the 5th minute. Tom BYRNE then gave the Harriers a 17th minute lead by curling the ball just inside the top left-hand corner at the second attempt. Mitch Butler volleyed wide on 24 minutes and Sheldon hit a bicycle-kick over the bar two minutes later.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's only real attempt of the first period came on the half-hour when Forsdick laid the ball off for Dave Haywood to cross and home goalkeeper John Danby lost the ball under pressure from Nick Smith before the ball was cleared.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz improved markedly after the break. Forsdick's 48th minute shot was turned onto the post by Danby but Steve POPE levelled by smashing home from the penalty spot in the 50th minute after Howard Forinton was pulled back by Troy Manning.</p>
  <p>After winning two corners in the 56th minute, Halesowen broke again in the 63rd minute following a Kiddy midfield slip with Chris Smith setting Forinton free, but he wasted the chance. Chris Smith then hit over the bar from 18 yards in the 69th minute. Ian Cooper's 71st minute volley was blocked and from the rebound Forinton was denied by Danby. Four minutes later Forinton pulled the ball back across goal to Forsdick but his goal-bound shot was cleared off the line by Chris McHale. Seconds before the end of normal time Lamey lobbed just over the bar from a long Coleman clearance and Forinton blasted over the stand when clear on goal.</p>
  <p>Two minutes into extra-time Lamey fed Forsdick and he turned in the area before crashing the ball off the underside off the crossbar. Laurie Wilson hit a 95th minute free-kick past the post for the increasingly quiet and tired hosts but Halesowen clawed the ball away at the foot of the post from Gavin Hurren's header and Sheldon's follow-up. After 104 minutes substitute home goalkeeper Thomas Harper saved from Forsdick at the second attempt and a fierce Stuart Skidmore shot was blocked with Harper beating the ball away from Lamey's resulting corner.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz finished strongly in the second period of extra-time with Lamey shooting just past the left upright after 111 minutes. A minute later Skidmore won the ball in midfield and set up Lamey but his 15-yard strike struck the left-hand post. Remarkably, Forsdick struck the post again in the 116th minute and McHale cleared off the line from Lamey a minute later.</p>
  <p>The marathon tie was finally settled in the 118th minute when Forinton headed on a long Coleman goal-kick for Lamey to expertly beat the poorly positioned home goalkeeper Harper from 20 yards. In the final minute Coleman secured Halesowen's hand on the Cup with a fine reflex save to deny substitute Ray Facey.</p>

    <h3>Northwood 3 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A disappointing result, but it really was one of those matches when we could have played all night and never got anything out of the game.</p>
  <p>They were a big, hard-working side and the pitch was pretty poor which didn't help. The first half was dire, but they scored a pretty decent goal in the only piece of worthwhile action. Second-half we were much, much better, but when The Pope skyed a penalty about 10 feet over you could just tell what was going to happen. We were all over them but they caught us twice on the break and the day was summed up when Chris Smith's brilliant run and shot rebounded off the bar. Not a great day, but not half as bad as the result might suggest.</p>
  <p>We've got a few cup games coming up - the big one is the FA Trophy game on Saturday at home to Tamworth, but before then we go to Kiddy in the Worcester Senior on Wednesday.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Northwood: Watson; Nolan, Moore, O'Connor, Shipperley, Demetrious, Garrard (Shaw HT), Carter, Clark (Heselton 65), Dean (Ferdinand 85), Hart. Unused Subs: Meakin, Matthews</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Cooper, Haywood (C. Smith 80), Preston, Pope, Knight, Cowley (N. Smith 49), Lamey, Forinton, Amos (Strachan 65), Forsdick. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Pierpoint</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Legg  Attendance: 182 Booked: Preston (29), Pope (86), Knight (87)</p>
  <p>Halesowen crashed to their worst defeat of the season at bottom-placed crisis club Northwood.</p>
  <p>The battling home side took a narrow first-half lead in the first ever meeting between the two clubs as captain Luke Garrard ran the show from midfield. However, Halesowen made a storming start to the second-half but squandered a host of chances to find their way back with Steve Pope missing a penalty before the Woods added two late goals on the break.</p>
  <p>Nathan Lamey surged down the right in the 6th minute but his cross was just too high for Howard Forinton. Gary Knight cleared Garrard's cross a minute later and in the 10th minute goalkeeper Dean Coleman easily collected James Shipperley's header from Dean Clark's free-kick.</p>
  <p>Dave Haywood drove a 30-yard drive over the bar into the adjoining graveyard in the 11th minute but the hosts took a 22nd minute lead when Gavin Hart split the visiting defence to put Peter Dean free against Coleman and he crossed for CLARK to tap home in front of goal.</p>
  <p>Five minutes later home goalkeeper Liam Watson did well to react to Forinton's back-header from Haywood's free-kick. In the next minute Garrard put Dean free again but he blasted wide from a good position ten yards out and on the half-hour Wayne Carter drilled wide of the Halesowen upright. For Halesowen, Ian Cooper volleyed over the bar and Alex Cowley's 39th minute cross was gathered by Watson. Four minutes before the break, Coleman saved after Dean was put through again and the rebound shot from Shayne Demetrious was then blocked.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were much improved after the interval with Forinton just failing to get a strong enough header to Lamey's 46th minute cross before Watson saved from Lamey after 48 minutes. The visitors then missed a golden opportunity when Jason O'Connor pushed Forinton in the area but Steve Pope blasted the resulting penalty high over the bar.  Simon Forsdick burst through in the 54th minute to set up Forinton but he struck wide from just ten yards and a minute later Lamey flashed another good chance wide. Forsdick's 63rd minute shot was then superbly blocked by Shipperley when a cross from Nick Amos was headed back across goal by Lamey. The visitors then forced two corners following a 70th minute shot from substitute Nick Smith.</p>
  <p>But the Yeltz were then caught out on the break when Dean beat the offside trap and ran on 40 yards before rolling the ball across goal for substitute Alistair HESELTON to convert from close range. Worse followed in the 80th minute when Heselton headed on for DEAN to bury a low shot into the graveyard-end for a third goal from the edge of the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Eight minutes from time home goalkeeper Watson was finally beaten by substitute Chris Smith but the ball cannoned off the crossbar and in the dying minutes both Pope and Knight were booked as their frustration grew.</p>

    <h3>FAT 3QR  Yeltz 3 Sutton Coldfield 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz won through in the end to clinch an exciting tie with Conference side Tamworth, although it wasn't as easy as the scoreline might suggest (according to  Dave's match report ). Goals from Fozzy, Nathan and The Pope took us through to the First Round Proper on December 17th.</p>
  <p>A little more on the board restructuring - as far as I can tell the number of directors has been reduced to hopefully attract further investors. The old directors are still going to be involved in running the club, so in reality it shouldn't make any difference and hopefully we may get other people coming in to help out Nigel and the other directors financially. All seems pretty reasonable I think.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we travel to bottom placed  <a href="http://www.northwoodfc.com/">Northwood</a>  in a game we must be hopeful of winning. However they beat Merthyr away last week so their no mugs. I'll be making a rare visit but with Frank over from Spain please blame him if it all goes wrong.</p>

  <p>Halesowen booked an attractive tie against Conference giant-killers Tamworth in the next round after riding their early luck to record a flattering scoreline.</p>
  <p>The Royals dominated the first half but failed to take advantage of a string of good chances and finally succumbed after being reduced to nine men in the latter stages.</p>
  <p>The Royals dominated the first half but failed to take advantage of a string of good chances and finally succumbed after being reduced to nine men in the latter stages.</p>
  <p>Halesowen eventually sprung into life in the 17th minute when Nathan Lamey beat the offside trap but he lobbed the good chance over the bar from Dave Haywood's long ball.</p>
  <p>A through ball from Liam Hebberd carved open Halesowen yet again after 21 minutes but Markman screwed just wide. Goalkeeper Dean Coleman then collected the ball on the half-hour after a spell of ping-pong in the home area and saved from Hood a minute later for fortunate Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Alex Cowley beat off a couple of challenges to shoot wide from 15 yards in the 33rd minute and seconds later Simon Forsdick skipped down the wing before blasting high. But yet another chance went begging for the visitors after 36 minutes when Coleman lost the ball but recovered to save from Markman and force a corner.</p>
  <p>Sutton paid the price for failing to capitalise when Lamey's clever touch set up FORSDICK to bury a 10-yard volley two minutes before the interval to give Halesowen a lead they hardly deserved.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's performance showed no improvement after the interval as they continued to struggle to control the game against their lower league opposition. Nevertheless, two more goals were added from just three second-half attempts on goal after frustrated Sutton twice saw red.</p>
  <p>Nick Smith volleyed straight at Belford after 47 minutes and five minutes later Hebberd's cross was marginally too high for his supporting forwards at the other end.</p>
  <p>A dreary second period came to life when Sutton were reduced to ten men when Lucan Spittle committed two yellow card offences within three minutes by hacking down Lamey on the hour and then making a clumsy lunge at Howard Forinton.</p>
  <p>Halesowen went on to add a second goal in the 76th minute when Forinton set Forsdick free down the left and his cross picked out LAMEY to comfortably hit the net from 5 yards.</p>
  <p>Worse followed for Sutton when Haywood's long ball found Lamey and his legs were taken by Hood who anticipated his punishment by immediately walking off the field without waiting for his inevitable red card. Steve POPE stepped up to smash home the resulting 84th minute penalty and put Halesowen into the next round at home to Tamworth on Saturday 17th December.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 King's Lynn 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Many years agon in the fanzine I made some lame joke about us going top of the league after the rules being changed to 3 points for a draw, 1 for a win. With our 9th draw in 17 league games we'd be comfortably top of that league, but back in the real world we're in 9th just hovering below the play-off zone.</p>
  <p>In other news gleaned from the  <a href="http://www.halesowentownfc.co.uk">excellent official website</a> , Ben Steane has been released to go to Brackley. In my opinion Ben never quite fulfilled the promise (and the large transfer fee) he undoubtedly had, although obviously he was extremely unlucky with injuries. Let's hope we can afford to replace him with a top midfielder that could make a lot of difference.</p>
  <p>Also, the board has been restructured to dratically reduce the number of directors to three. I was out of the country so I couldn't make the EGM, which means I don't really know what this means, but I'm hoping it will help us move forward both on and off the field. More if I hear more from people who were there.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we have an important replay at home to Sutton Coldfield in the Trophy, with the winners meeting FA Cup 2nd Round winners and local rivals Tamworth. A mouth watering clash, and we really need to get through - let's hope for the best!</p>

  <p>The Yeltz had won each of the previous three meetings between the clubs by a single goal without reply and there never looked to be much different on offer this time in a dreary first half.</p>
  <p>Despite the two league-leading marksmen being on display, the Linnets appeared happy to play for a goal-less point and Halesowen lacked the killer punch to prevent them doing so.</p>
  <p>Nathan Lamey's 2nd minute shot was blocked from Dave Haywood's free-kick and Howard Forinton crossed over the bar 16 minutes into the scrappy start to the game.</p>
  <p>Grant Cooper's 17th minute shot was deflected over the bar for a corner kick but Halesowen gained possession and made a quick break up the field with Forinton finding Cowley but his dangerous cross ran along the six-yard box. Steve Pope then scooped a loose ball over the King's bar from five yards out in the 22nd minute.</p>
  <p>The Linnets hardly threatened as an attacking force and goalkeeper Dean Coleman had a largely redundant afternoon after comfortably collecting a cross from Matt O'Halloran in the 25th minute.</p>
  <p>Forinton looped a 29th minute header at goalkeeper John Higgs and then almost latched onto the ball in the 35th minute but Higgs raced off his line to save. In between, Danny Bloomfield struck past the Halesowen post from the edge of the area after Halesowen lost the ball in midfield.</p>
  <p>Cowley continued to be the outlet creating most danger from the Yeltz and his 40th minute shot from an acute angle was blocked by the packed King's Lynn defence following a decent spell of Halesowen pressure before the interval.</p>
  <p>At the start of the second period another Cowley cross went begging in the 48th minute before Bloomfield turned well to fire just wide of Coleman's post five minutes later.</p>
  <p>The Linnets seemed increasingly content to play for a draw and continued to defend in depth with Halesowen unable to break the stalemate despite their dominance. Simon Forsdick shot well wide through a mass of defenders after 66 minutes and Cowley cut in from the right following a fine run in the 69th minute but Adam Jones headed away for a corner. Forsdick's 72nd minute header was then turned away and from the resulting corner Nick Amos powered a header just wide.</p>
  <p>On the counter-attack substitute Danny Hammond's 76th minute shot struck O'Halloran with Bloomfield unmarked at the far post for King's Lynn.</p>
  <p>Lamey wasted an 81st minute free-kick by blasting well wide from 25 yards but then combined well with Forinton to produce Halesowen's clearest chance of the afternoon a minute later but Higgs blocked well when Forinton tried to place his shot.</p>
  <p>Despite a couple more late corners, Halesowen could not break the deadlock and had to settle for their 9th league draw of the season.</p>

    <h3>FAT 3Q  Sutton Coldfield 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It all seems a bit local, but the Trophy is becoming very interesting. After a 1-1 draw at Sutton Coldfield on Saturday, the replay was called of due to bad weather. The winner of the game will play Tamworth at home, which is a very good draw from our point of view. Obviously they've risen through the leagues recently right up to the Conference, but we've always done reasonably well against them and it would be great to get to play them again.</p>
  <p>On Saturday King's Lynn visit The Grove in the league. They're above us in the table but we've already won at their place and it would be very helpful to our league position if we could do the double over them.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Sutton Coldfield Town: Belford; Wolsey, Wilson, Hood, Moran, Dodds, Field, Owen, Rowe, Markman, Hebberd. Unused Subs: Daniels, Ling, Hazell, Maynard, Breedon (GK).</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Knight, Cowley, Lamey, Forinton, N. Smith, Amos. Unused Subs: Pierpoint, C. Smith, Steane, Skidmore, Johnson.</p>
  <p>Referee: R. J. Steans (Leics.) Attendance: 278 Booked: Cooper (38), Lamey (60), Hood (65), Field (72), Haywood (83), Wolsey (87).</p>
  <p>Halesowen were forced to a replay in their 50th FA Trophy game after a bright first-half start performance was pegged back by the Royals.</p>
  <p>Coles Lane has not been a happy-hunting ground for the Yeltz in recent seasons and in the first minute Halesowen escaped when the ball bobbled wide off Justin Rowe from Liam Hebberd's cross.</p>
  <p>But the Yeltz then took charge and could have wrapped up the tie by half-time. Nathan Lamey hit a tame 4th minute free-kick at veteran goalkeeper Dale Belford and three minutes later Alex Cowley made a superb solo run through the heart of the Sutton defence beating five players on his way before finally sprawling in the area as he rounded Belford. However, the referee waved play on and then turned down another loud appeal for a penalty due to alleged handball as Belford tipped Howard Forinton's 15th minute effort was over the bar.</p>
  <p>But a minute later FORINTON gave Halesowen the lead by calmly placing his 12-yard shot into the top corner after Cowley's shot was blocked in a crowded goal-mouth from Halesowen's third successive corner.</p>
  <p>Sutton's prolific strike-force continued to be restricted although Rowe set up Craig Owen to screw wide on 26 minutes and Cowley's mistake allowed Matthew Dodds to tee up Owen in the 31st minute with visiting goalkeeper Dean Coleman gathering low down at the second attempt.</p>
  <p>Before the interval Belford made a 37th minute finger-tip save to turn Cowley's 20-yard shot for a corner and at the other end the Yeltz survived a moment of confusion between Coleman and Niki Preston on the stroke of half-time.</p>
  <p>In a more subdued second half Yeltz display, Belford made a couple of early clearances to deny Lamey and Forinton and on the hour Lamey picked out Forinton with a splendid left-wing cross but he headed high from 10-yards. A minute later Lamey then struck the side-netting from close range.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen conceding too much space in midfield, the Royals gradually began to take the upper hand and equalised in the 67th minute when the ball broke from a long throw-in for HEBBERD to drill home past Coleman from 15 yards.</p>
  <p>Cowley was brought down by Mark Wolsey in the 87th minute but Steve Pope's free-kick was blocked by the defensive wall and in the final minute Coleman easily collected Owen's 20-yard free-kick.</p>
  <p>In injury time Belford raced out to clear from Nick Smith after Lamey and Forinton combined leaving both clubs in the hat for Monday's draw with a replay at the Grove on Tuesday, 29th November, kick-off 7.45pm.</p>

    <h3>BSC  Willenhall 3 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>I guess many others share my lack of enthusiasm for the Senior Cups. A crowd of just 90 saw us lose to Willenhall 3-2 in the B'ham variety despite us twice being ahead from Nathan and The Pope. Oh well.</p>
  <p>More serious knockout action occurs on Saturday when we travel to Sutton Coldfireld in the Trophy. This is definitely a competition we want to do well in (with prize money available), so I'm hoping for a good performance to put us into the hat with the Conference teams.</p>

    <h3>Bedford 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We said we'd be pleased with a point so to keep the football cliche alive we must continue saying it. In this case it's true though, with a useful point gained with what, from all accounts I've heard, was a pretty good performance.</p>
  <p>We're in Cup action in the next week - first in the all-important Birmingham Senior Cup when we visit Willenhall on Tuesday (not at home as I put earlier), and then in the Trophy on Saturday when we make the short journey to Sutton Coldfield. I've no real interest in the first game, but let's hope we can continue our recent decent run in both games. I'd be pleased with that.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bedford Town: Brown; Childs, Lawley, Miller, Howarth, Stupple, Hatch (Williams 72), James, Dillon, Howe, Rydeheard (Woolf 82). Unused Subs: McElroy, Phillips, Farrell</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Pierpoint, Haywood, Preston, Knight, Cooper, Cowley, Lamey, Forinton, N. Smith (Steane 83), Amos. Unused Subs: C. Smith, Strachan, Skidmore, Johnson</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Comerford (Royston) Attendance: 505&#xD;
&#xD;
Booked: Pierpoint (56), Haywood (63)</p>
  <p>Halesowen deserved their share of the points with an excellent performance against the high-flying Eagles.</p>
  <p>But despite only notching just another draw, Halesowen can take a number of positives from their performance in matching one of the best teams in the league to maintain the steady improvement of recent weeks. Stuart Pierpoint and acting-captain Nicki Preston combined well with debut defender Gary Knight in a resolute defence and were helped by a midfield starting to play the passing game and enjoying long spells of possession.</p>
  <p>Bedford's biggest home attendance of the season saw their first minute corner cleared off the line after goalkeeper Dean Coleman failed to collect a high ball. At the other end, home goalkeeper Ian Brown was alert in the 4th minute to deny a Nick Amos header with a flying save.</p>
  <p>In even exchanges, Derwayne Stupple and Chris Dillon combined to go close in the 12th minute before Howard Forinton earned a 19th minute corner and then flicked a header at Brown a minute later for Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Preston made an important challenge to deny danger-man Dillon in the 27th minute and three minutes later Craig Rydeheard fired over the bar. With Halesowen then enjoying a good spell of pressure, Amos was blocked out in a crowded penalty area on the half-hour.</p>
  <p>In the 35th minute Halesowen held firm as Pierpoint made a splendid header off the line from Dillon and Coleman made a magnificent save to turn the ball around the post from Rene Howe in Bedford's best chance of the half.</p>
  <p>Leading up to half-time, Alex Cowley hit just over the bar, Nathan Lamey turned and volleyed at Brown and Preston struck just high from 12 yards in the end-to-end action. Seconds before the interval Howe broke free for Bedford and rounded Coleman but could only strike the side-netting from a wide angle.</p>
  <p>The second half continued to be keenly contested with Rydeheard's 50th minute shot collected by Coleman and two minutes later Lamey latched onto a loose ball but could only shoot straight at Brown from the edge of the area. Coleman then confidently collected James Hatch's 53rd minute header.</p>
  <p>On the hour Cowley burst down the right but paused too long before curling wide. However, six minutes later Cowley produced the best attempt of the game when his 15-yard shot rebounded off the crossbar with Brown beaten following good work from hard-working Lamey. Brown then blocked Nick Smith's 8-yard shot from a tight angle in the 70th minute.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to restrict the hosts and create chances as Amos nodded an 82nd minute header just wide. Two minutes from full-time Forinton worked his way around the home defence but lacked support when he pulled the ball back across the face of goal as the game ended in stalemate.</p>

    <h3>FAT 2Q  Yeltz 2 Aylesbury 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz progressed to the next round of the Trophy in what sounds like a well-deserved victory over league rivals Aylesbury. Goals from Nathan and Fozzy put us into Monday's draw for the next round, which will take place surprisingly quickly in a couple of weeks time. The Conference North and South teams come in at this round, so we can probably expect a reasonably tough draw, so let's hope for a home game (or a nice trip away to somewhere we haven't been before).</p>
  <p>On Saturday we're back in league action when we make the tricky away trip to 3rd placed Bedford. We got stuffed there last year although beat them in the return at The Grove, so I think any points we can pick up there will be good. As ever, I'm hoping for the best!</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Cooper, Harkness, Preston, Pope, Steane (N. Smith 70), Cowley (Skidmore 80), Lamey (C. Smith 83), Forinton, Amos, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Pierpoint, Johnson</p>
  <p>Aylesbury United: Rashid; Williams, Mead, Lazarus (Joe 52), Hayward, Gould, McCafferty (Powles 76), Bewers, Jaggard, Ngoyi (De Souza 63), Edgeworth. Unused Subs: None</p>
  <p>Referee: L. Tavinder (Cheddleton, Staffs.) Attendance: 374 Booked: Preston (45), Harkness (80), Joe (90). Sponsors' Man of the Match: Alex Cowley</p>
  <p>Halesowen booked their place in the next round with a comfortable victory over out-of-form Aylesbury.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz made a positive start but missed a string of good early chances to make the game safe. Nathan Lamey tangled with goalkeeper Jack Rashid in the 2nd minute but Simon Forsdick waited to long and wasted the rebound with Alex Cowley's shot eventually blocked for a corner. Ben Steane flashed a cross-shot across goal three minutes later but Forsdick turned the ball wide from close range. Howard Forinton then missed a gilt-edged chance with a free header inside the Aylesbury six-yard box from Cowley's pinpoint 12th minute cross.</p>
  <p>Bottom of current-form Aylesbury weathered the early storm and showed their hand when Gregory Ngoyi screwed a 16th minute shot wide from 20 yards out. Paul Edgeworth then headed a good opportunity over the bar from a Neil Lazarus cross five minutes later.</p>
  <p>Forsdick missed his third good opportunity of the first period in the 24th minute when he headed another measured cross from Cowley over the bar.</p>
  <p>Aylesbury almost sneaked a 26th minute goal when a poor back-header from Jon Harkness let in Gavin Jaggard but Nicki Preston spared the blushes by racing back to clear off the line with goalkeeper Dean Coleman beaten. At the other end Rashid collected Lamey's 36th minute cross at the second attempt with Halesowen just failing to gel with the final ball up front after dominating the first half.</p>
  <p>Man-of-the-match Cowley continued to pose a constant threat at the start of the second half and hit just wide in the 46th minute after a neat interchange with Lamey. Steve Pope then hit high over the Old Hawne Lane stand from Cowley's 51st minute corner and with the Yeltz making heavy weather of finding the net from all their pressure, Forinton's 63rd minute header was easily collected by Rashid.</p>
  <p>But Halesowen finally took a well-deserved 64th minute lead when leading scorer LAMEY picked up a clever flick from Forinton and struck a sweet 15-yard drive against the post before calmly despatching the rebound past bemused Rashid. A 67th minute free-kick from on-loan Harkness fell just wide and a 69th minute chip from Steane was then collected by Rashid as the Yeltz sought to secure more goals.</p>
  <p>FORSDICK finally wrapped up the tie in the 82nd minute when he took on and beat the final defender Robert Gould down the left before hitting home a fierce low drive off the far post.</p>
  <p>In injury time Greg Williams hit the side-netting from close range but it was too little too late for the well beaten Ducks.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Cirencester 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz gained a point at The Grove against Cirencester with a 1-1 draw. It sounds from  Dave's match report  that a few fireworks went off during the match, with both teams having a man sent off. I couldn't figure out any more Bonfire Night related puns so you should just read the report (and I'll give myself a rocket for writing so poorly).</p>
  <p>On Saturday we play Aylesbury at home in the Trophy. They're on a terrible run (2 draws and 5 losses) and we're due a decent run in the competition - so I'm trying not to expect the worse. Let's hope we can get through to the 3rd Round for the first time in 3 years (the year we lost at Alfreton).</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Cooper, Harkness (N. Smith HT), Preston, Pope, Steane, Cowley, Lamey, Forinton, Amos, Forsdick. Unused Subs: C. Smith, Skidmore, Pierpoint, Johnson.</p>
  <p>Cirencester Town: Book; Arndale, Fullam, Jackson, Horgan, Viveash, Robison, Richards, Hopkins, Cowe, Halliday. Unused Subs: L. Smith, Stanley, Fraser, Griffin.</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Murphy (Coventry)      Attendance: 367&#xD;
Booked: Horgan (29), Pope (90)     Sent Off: Horgan (59), Forsdick (90)</p>
  <p>Halesowen had to settle for a draw despite the Centurions being reduced to ten men for most of the second half.</p>
  <p>Gary Horgan was dismissed in the 59th minute for fouling Nicki Preston with his second offence of the afternoon. Halesowen were themselves reduced to ten men deep in injury time when goalscorer Simon Forsdick responded to a taunt by raising his hand to Craig Fullum's face and harshly received a straight red card.</p>
  <p>With the visitors lacking confidence after a poor run of results, Horgan hit over Halesowen's bar in the second minute and in the 5th minute Gareth Hopkins found himself free on the left but the out-of-form striker blasted high.</p>
  <p>Alex Cowley's 9th minute drive was easily collected by visiting goalkeeper Steve Book and in the 18th minute league-leading goal-scorer Nathan Lamey flashed a shot across the Cirencester goal.</p>
  <p>Cirencester enjoyed the better of play in the first period and a 23rd minute Mark Richards shot earned a corner with the home defence exposed before Horgan's 33rd minute attempt drifted just wide.</p>
  <p>Halesowen found it tough to break down a well organised defence marshalled by Adi Viveash although Ian Cooper delivered a couple of dangerous crosses late in the half.</p>
  <p>Kevin HALLIDAY gave the visitors the lead with a soft goal in first half injury time when his seemingly poorly hit 30-yard free-kick trundled through the defensive wall and rolled on to creep beyond Preston and under unsighted goalkeeper Dean Coleman.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz produced a better second-half performance with Cowley proving to be a constant menace down the right wing. On 50 minutes Cowley's good turn and cross was cleared by Viveash and five minutes later Howard Forinton fired wide after being set up by Lamey.</p>
  <p>Halesowen stepped up the pressure after Horgan's dismissal with Darren Robison heading over his own bar from another dangerous Cowley cross in the 64th minute.</p>
  <p>FORSDICK levelled the score in the 67th minute by converting Cowley's deep right-wing cross despite Book almost saving the close range shot.</p>
  <p>But the Centurions should have regained the lead three minutes later when Coleman spilled Neil Arndale's cross and Hopkins blazed the loose ball over the bar from just three yards.</p>
  <p>Halesowen could not find enough extra flair to create a second goal against ten-man Cirencester with Forsdick shooting high in the 71st minute and Lamey rolling just wide from Steve Pope's 77th minute cross. Forsdick's 82nd minute header looped onto the roof of the net after Preston's cross was headed back across goal. Steve Cowe curled just wide with five minutes remaining at the other end.</p>
  <p>Pope was booked for complaining about Forsdick's last-gasp sending-off seconds before the final whistle and both players will now receive suspensions later in November.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Grantham 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After our decent run of late, it's a bit disappointing that we lost 2-0 last night at home to Grantham. Two first half goals means we're back into  10th place  (I hope - my stats have been a bit unreliable recently!) - although still only 4 points off the play-off zone. More details in DJ's match report.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we make what must be our first visit to Cheshunt - let's hope it can be a winning one. I'm off visiting one of the Spanish branches of our supporters club, so updates may be a little slow over the weekend.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Pierpoint (Steane 74), Harkness, Preston, Pope (Skidmore 79), Cooper, Cowley, Lamey, C. Smith (Amos 74), N. Smith, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Johnson, Haywood.</p>
  <p>Grantham Town: Ziccardi; Wooding (Francis 71), Weale, Sturgess, Julian, Brown, F. Smith, Glover, Carruthers (Turner 33), Sneddon (Evans 89), Matthews. Unused Sub: Speed.</p>
  <p>Referee: L. Sinclair (Brierley Hill)      Attendance: 291</p>
  <p>Halesowen could provide no response after falling behind to two first-half defensive lapses.</p>
  <p>After four games without a win Grantham made their intentions known when player-manager Lee Glover drilled past the post in the 5th minute.</p>
  <p>Alex Cowley cut in for Halesowen in the 7th minute and visiting goalkeeper Mario Ziccardi did just enough to divert the ball away as the hosts forced a couple of corners a minute later. Cowley's 11th minute cross was then almost met by Simon Forsdick at the far post and Nick Smith saw his 17th minute strike from 22 yards tipped over the bar by Ziccardi.</p>
  <p>But the Gingerbreads took a 23rd minute lead when GLOVER's quickly taken 20-yard free-kick caught out the home defence and dipped beyond young goalkeeper Dean Coleman. Fabian Smith and Martin Carruthers made a neat 26th minute interchange to earn a Grantham corner and on the half-hour Glover collected a short corner and set up Adam Sturgess to fire at Coleman.</p>
  <p>The visitors increased the lead after 35 minutes when Coleman dropped Richard Weale's corner and although he recovered to save from substitute Jason Turner, Michael SNEDDON's looping header found the net from the rebound as the ball ping-ponged around the home penalty area.</p>
  <p>Although the Yeltz had plenty of pressure after the break, it was to no avail and Ziccardi comfortably dealt with a number of crosses in an uninspiring second-half. Another Nick Smith drive after 46 minutes produced the same result as the first half as Ziccardi again tipped the ball over the bar from a similar position. The ball then bounced off Tim Wooding's shoulder for a corner on 48 minutes and Ziccardi collected Nathan Lamey's corner a minute later.</p>
  <p>On-loan Jon Harkness looked impressive for the home side as his 56th minute free-kick was deflected for a corner and then watched his 64th minute free-kick fall inches wide of the post.</p>
  <p>With Grantham happy to sit back and protect their comfortable lead, Turner produced their only chance of the half by shooting wide after being set up by Sneddon on 73 minutes.</p>
  <p>Steve Pope limped off after receiving a worrying 79th minute injury and with five minutes remaining Forsdick lost his marker but headed straight at Ziccardi as the game petered out allowing Grantham to leave the Grove with points at the ninth time of trying.</p>

    <h3>Bath City 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz gained a valuable point with a 0-0 draw away at Bath. With lots of injuries this is a pretty creditable performance as it's never an easy place to go.</p>
  <p>Surprisingly enough there appears to be some difference of opinion on whether we were terrible and just went to stifle the game, or whether we played quite well - it's no surprise which side has which opinion - but obviously we're right as we're proven experts on football as well as generally neutral on these things.</p>
  <p>We're next in action on Tuesday when Grantham visit The Grove. They're 7th (not 3rd!) in  the table , but we've already got a draw at their place so let's hope for a win to keep up right in touch.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Darren</h3>

  <p>Bath City:- Evans, S Jones, Power, Coupe, G Jones, Harris (Ford 78), Bird, Holloway, Walsh, Partridge (Paul 82), Sandell. Unused subs:- Clarke, York, Bryant</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town:-  Coleman, Pierpoint, Harkness, Preston, Pope (c), Amos, N Smith, Lamey, C Smith (Strachan 86), Cooper (Skidmore 69), Forsdick. Unused&#xD;
subs:- Cowley, Steane, Johnson.</p>
  <p>Booked: Pope 73, Pierpoint 83. Attendance: 580</p>
  <p>Due to injuries Halesowen fielded a much changed side from the previous few matches. However it didn't appear to disrupt them too much as they battled hard to earn a good point and frustrate Bath City at Twerton Park.</p>
  <p>Nick Smith earned the Yeltz an early free kick and new loan signing Harkness was unlucky with his first contribution on 3 minutes when he struck a free kick over the wall but Paul Evans in the Bath goal tipped over.</p>
  <p>Bath responded well and a throw in on 5 minutes was headed just wide by Walsh on 5 minutes. On 9 minutes a Harkness through ball allowed Nathan Lamey to break free down the left and he pulled back a cross to Chris Smith who hit wide after the defender missed the ball completely.</p>
  <p>Another Walsh header following a diagonal cross was just over on 23 minutes. Halesowen won a corner on 26 minutes, which Nick Smith picked up the short corner and crossed, but Bath cleared well</p>
  <p>Pressure from Bath resulted in a free kick being conceded on 35 minutes by captain Pope, but Sandell's free kick on the left was well gathered by Coleman. Another free kick on 39 minutes resulted in a similar catch by Coleman stopping the Bath pressure.</p>
  <p>On the stroke of half time an effort by Nick Smith was well wide after he was put through by Amos.</p>
  <p>The second half began with a slight delay on 47 minutes after Harris fell awkwardly for the home side. Lamey won a free kick just after the delay but was cleared well.</p>
  <p>Harkness swung another excellent left footed cross on 54 minutes but Evans caught well under pressure. Three minutes later and Harkness blasted over from outside the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were awarded a free kick on 58 minutes in their own area much to the Bath City fan's annoyance, when a Coleman clearance hit the arm of the advancing City player.</p>
  <p>A Lamey header went close on 59 minutes after Harkness put over another good cross.</p>
  <p>Coleman saved well on 61 minutes, but the ball fell to Partridge who hit the ball against the post with the goal open. The play was broke up in the final 20 minutes with several substitutions by both sides as Bath tried to get the home win and Halesowen held strong for the point.</p>
  <p>A Pope handball gave away a free kick on the right on 70 minutes which resulted in a shot being well tipped round the post by a diving Coleman. &#xD;
Holloway narrowly headed wide on 85 minutes but Bath couldn't find a way through, and on 88 minutes Halesowen nearly snatched all three points when Forsdick laid back to Nick Smith who hit a strong shot but Evans was well placed to save.</p>

  <p>A late kickoff, a late equaliser and a late winner meant the indomitable Yeltz battled through to the next round of the FA Trophy with a 3-2 victory away to Willenhall.

  <p>On Saturday we're back to league action with a difficult away game against Bath City. They're just two points above us in the table, but it's never been an easy place to visit so any points we can pick up will be good.</p>

  <p>Halesowen battled through to the net round with a dramatic 90th minute equaliser from Simon Forsdick and a late extra-time winner from Nicki Preston eventually overcoming Willenhall's stern resistance.</p>
  <p>A long evening of football concluded at 10.40pm after extra-time with a delayed 8.10pm kick-off caused by the non-arrival of FA-appointed assistant referees, resulting in the recruitment of emergency replacement local officials.</p>
  <p>In even early exchanges, Craig Holland's 5th minute shot bounced past Dean Coleman's post after a series of deflections before Halesowen won an 8th minute Nathan Lamey corner. Alex Cowley then sent in a 16th minute cross and Simon Forsdick won a right-wing corner a minute later as the Yeltz eased into their stride.</p>
  <p>Nick AMOS unlocked the home defence by heading home directly from Cowley's corner to give Halesowen an 18th minute lead. Two minutes later Dave Haywood drilled just wide from 20 yards.</p>
  <p>But the tough-tackling Lockmen were allowed to equalise just four minutes later on 22 minutes with Aaron BISHOP converting another direct header at the far post from Dominic Reece's 25-yard right-wing free-kick.</p>
  <p>Halesowen responded and continued to press with Lamey trying just too much in the penalty area on 25 minutes before Haywood's cross fell just wide. Another free header from Amos then almost caught out goalkeeper Danny Tipton in the 28th minute and a minute later Chris Smith was put through but his first touch was too strong, allowing Tipton to claim the ball. Unconvincing Tipton then gathered the ball at his post when Amos headed onto Lamey on the half hour. Hard-working Lamey worked his way around the home defence in the 39th minute but his cross ran along the goal-line.</p>
  <p>The uncompromising first-half led to yet more Yeltz injuries with Haywood (knee) and Amos (calf) both requiring enforced replacements at half-time.</p>
  <p>In the second half Cowley hit Lamey's 52nd minute left-wing cross over the bar in a crowded area and Gary Hay cut in to fire over Halesowen's bar a minute later at the other end. Hay smashed well over the bar again in the 62nd minute after Nicki Preston ducked and allowed the ball to find home captain Martin Myers. Tipton then kicked the ball away to deny Forsdick at the far post from Lamey's 64th minute free-kick.</p>
  <p>After a good spell of Willenhall pressure, substitute Stuart Pierpoint was on hand to make an important 76th minute clearance. But the hosts grabbed a 80th minute lead after Pierpoint's slip allowed Dean PERROW to pick up the ball and beat goalkeeper Coleman from 22 yards.</p>
  <p>Chris Smith's was clear after 81 minutes but was blocked by Tipton and a minute later Holland's deflected shot was collected by Coleman at the other end.</p>
  <p>Walking wounded Halesowen looked to be bowing out of the FA Trophy until FORSDICK latched onto a long clearance from Coleman in the 90th minute and chipped over Tipton into an empty net</p>
  <p>As the game entered extra-time, Halesowen's extra fitness became evident with Willenhall failing to threaten.</p>
  <p>Tireless Lamey led the line brilliantly and his 91st minute free-kick was sliced over his own bar by Myers in the 91st minute. Lamey then rolled just past the post from 20-yards out five minutes later. Tipton cleared a corner from Preston at the start of the second period of extra-time before collecting Pope's 111th minute header from another Lamey corner.</p>
  <p>PRESTON headed home the decisive winning goal in the 114th minute from a well delivered free-kick from substitute Ben Steane. With Willenhall out of steam, Cowley displayed amazing fitness to make a right-wing run and then chase up and almost catch out Tipton with three minutes of extra-time remaining.</p>
  <p>Halesowen move on to meet Aylesbury United at home in the 2nd Qualifying Round on November 12th.</p>

    <h3>FAT 1Q  Yeltz 0 Willenhall 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz remain in the FA Trophy after drawing 0-0 against Western Division opponents Willenhall at The Grove.</p>
  <p>It was always going to be a tricky tie, but from what I've heard we probably had enough chances to win it. Still, it sets up an interesting replay on Tuesday.</p>
  <p>Once again, there appear to have been some incidents after the game involving "fans" and the manager and Nigel Pitt. I have no idea what actually happened, but I can only repeat what I've said before - if all you are going to do is moan about everything then it would be better if you didn't bother supporting us any more.</p>
  <p>We've had more ill-informed comments criticising the manager, for things like making "tactical" substitutions when amazing enough the players concerned were injured. Do people really think the manager is a complete idiot? The arrogance and lack of respect of some people astounds me.</p>
  <p>All I can ask the moaners is this - stop f**king moaning and get behind the club before it all falls apart. Is that what you really want? (No apologies for the bad language - I'm not writing this lightly).</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Johnson (Cooper 23), Haywood, Preston, Pope, Amos, Cowley (Strachan 64), Lamey, Forinton (C. Smith 76), N. Smith, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Pierpoint.</p>
  <p>Willenhall Town: Tipton; Woodvine, Reece, Khela (Vaughan 53), Bishop, Holland (Swann 81), Campbell, Myers, Hay, Perrow, Danks. Unused Subs: Quilt, Sheppard, Hopkins.</p>
  <p>Referee: D. Brockwell (Northampton)  Attendance: 326    Booked: Lamey (61).</p>
  <p>Willenhall forced a replay with a stalemate in the FA Trophy first-hurdle as Halesowen failed to beat lower league opposition in Cup football for the second successive Saturday.</p>
  <p>Injuries to key players caused particular concern for Halesowen. Howard Forinton limped off with a hamstring injury, Alex Cowley was replaced due to a calf injury and Johnson strained his thigh, with all expected to miss the Tuesday replay.</p>
  <p>The Lockmen started eagerly in the perfect playing conditions. Gary Hay returned to the Grove after his brief spell earlier in the season and provided an excellent 6th minute cross from the right for Dominic Reece to volley wide from 10 yards. Two minutes later Dean Perrow then powered a header wide from Reece's left wing cross.</p>
  <p>For Halesowen, Alex Cowley's 13th minute effort was cleared off the line by Aaron Bishop and Cowley's 17th minute run into the box was ended by Dave Woodvine. With Willenhall creating the clearer chances both Perrow and Hay dragged efforts wide on 25 minutes and on the half-hour home goalkeeper Dean Coleman claimed a weak back-header from Nicki Preston at Hay's feet.</p>
  <p>In end-to-end play at the end of the first half, Steve Pope headed Nathan Lamey's free-kick wide after 33 minutes. Four minutes later, Simon Forsdick picked up a loose ball in the visiting penalty area and side-stepped the last defender but blasted Halesowen's best chance of the half well over the bar from 8 yards. Two minutes before the interval Perrow turned in the Halesowen area but Coleman saved his low drive near the post.</p>
  <p>The visitors took the game to Halesowen at the start of the second-half and created a string of good chances. Perrow's dangerous 47th minute cross was just missed by Martin Myers in front of goal and on 54 minutes Perrow put Nicky Campbell through but he elected to square the ball to Hay when well placed. Paul Danks then turned in the box but scuffed his shot straight at a grateful Coleman in the 57th minute. Substitute Ian Cooper was on hand to clear a 63rd minute shot from Hay off the line for Halesowen's troubled defence.</p>
  <p>Willenhall had a 66th minute let-off when substitute Craig Strachan delivered a free-kick for Pope to glance a header onto the far post. A high-ball from Cooper then led to Howard Forinton being injured in a 75th minute challenge on Willenhall goalkeeper Danny Tipton.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz finished the game strongly but wasted three good chances in the final ten minutes. Substitute Chris Smith struck the post in front of an open goal after 83 minutes from a rebound when Tipton saved after Lamey's persistence saw him win the ball in the area.</p>
  <p>Forsdick then latched onto a long 87th minute clearance from Coleman but his weak effort was easily saved by Tipton. Tipton then produced an excellent point-blank save in the final minute to keep out Pope's close range header from Lamey's free-kick and secure a replay at Noose Lane.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 7 Yate 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz bounced back from Saturday's cup defeat and a lot of criticism with an impressive 7-2 victory over struggling Yate. Two goals each from Nick Smith and H and a hat-trick from Nathan made it a night to remember in front of a disappointing crowd of 243.</p>
  <p>There's been lots of calls on  YeltzTalk  for the manager to be sacked, but maybe they'll disappear for a while after last night. The thing that is frustrating me is the way some people are determined to see it as a black and white issue - you're either 100% against the manager or 100% for him - a stance which is guaranteed to cause friction in the club.</p>
  <p>My stance on this has been pretty consistent over the years - you support the club as much as you can even when you might have some reservations, unless it gets so bad that something must be done. Even then you can trust the people who run the club to do the right thing, as they are fans too and will know when the time is right to change things.</p>
  <p>To point out the bleeding obvious once again - we are a small non-league club not Man. Utd., and we are all in this together. We are becoming a laughing stock amongst fans from other clubs, and frankly I'm embarrased by some of the posts that are on this site. Think how you want our (yes OUR) club is portrayed before you leave a message.</p>
  <p>What a pain to have to write all that after a stunning 7-2 victory. Still, we're back in action on Saturday in the FA Trophy with a tricky tie at home to Willenhall.</p>

    <h3>FAC 3Q  Yeltz 0 Bromsgrove 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz were knocked out of the FA Cup on Saturday by local rivals Bromsgrove, losing 2-0 at a very wet Grove.</p>
  <p>To be honest they were a decent team, playing some good football considering the conditions, but it was pretty even all the way through. The first goal was always going to be crucial, and once they'd scored in the second half on the rebound from a speculative long-shot it was going to be hard. The second killed us off, and we probably didn't deserve much more seeing as we never made Tim Clarke make a save. Ho Hum.</p>
  <p>It was my first time seeing us play this season (plenty of other jinx candidates though!) and it was a little disappointing. I was very impressed by H up front, but Fozzy was unrecognisable (not just because he's got no hair) and we didn't really pass it well at all. Completely unfair to judge on one day in the wet though, so I'll leave it at that.</p>
  <p>We're back to league action on Tuesday when Yate are the visitors. They've not had a great start, but won 4-1 against Cheshunt on Saturday so, like most games in this league, it isn't going to be easy.</p>

    <h3>BSC  Yeltz 1 Redditch 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Another win for the indomitable Yeltz as we progressed through to the next round of the B'ham Senior Cup with a one-oh victory over Redditch. A rare goal from Dave Haywood just before half-time cliched it, and it's good to see Ben Steane made a comeback after a long period of injury.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we're in cup action again, this time the FA Cup 3rd Qualifying Round at home to Bromsgrove. As well as the glory of the cup and the attraction of playing league sides, it's important that we win for the prize money that a good run generates - all in all a very important game. Don't forget we kick off at 2pm because of the England game afterwards.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Darren</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town team:- Coleman, Johnson, Haywood, Preston (c), Pierpoint (Forsdick 81), Cooper, Steane (Cowley 65), Lamey, C Smith, N Smith, Skidmore (Amos 72). Unused subs:- Forinton, Pope</p>
  <p>Redditch United:- Solly, Clarke, Pearce, Scheppel, Knight (c), Flynn, Moore, Doyle, Rickards, Woodley, Charlton. Unused subs:- Creighton, Jenkins, Taylor Unused, Cornelius</p>
  <p>Attendance: 227</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town progressed to the 3rd round of the Birmingham Senior Cup with a hard fought and well deserved victory against Nationwide North rivals Redditch United at the Grove.</p>
  <p>Straight from the kick off Nathan Lamey ran at the Redditch defence and hit a shot off target. With the returning Ben Steane in midfield, his probing 9th minute cross was well collected by Solly in the Reds goal. Scheppel went close on 15 minutes with a snapshot from the edge of the area that went over.</p>
  <p>A foul by Pearce on Lamey resulted in a free kick which Lamey hit wide on 21 minutes. Good work by Nick Smith on 33 minutes allowed the ball to fall to namesake Chris who lobbed just wide from the edge of the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Coleman was alert to another long range effort on 36 minutes. A break on 37 minutes allowed Rickards to cross for the incoming Wilding, but the defence stood firm and blocked. A corner was then headed just over by Wilding on 39 minutes as Redditch showed signs of pressuring the Yeltz goal.</p>
  <p>A 41st minute run at the defence by Chris Smith from the right allowed him to feed a through ball to Lamey who's miscued shot fell to DAVE HAYWOOD who rounded the keeper and put the Yeltz one up. Cooper then drove just wide in first half injury time after good work from Steane.</p>
  <p>Early second half pressure resulted in a corner to Halesowen and Nick Smith met the quickly taken short corner and saw his header tipped over by Solly on 51 minutes. A corner from Charlton on 57 was well gathered by Coleman in the Halesowen goal.</p>
  <p>A Haywood free kick on 61 minutes was excellently headed towards the Redditch goal by Nathan Lamey but the ball struck the crossbar and went over.</p>
  <p>Sustained Redditch pressure in the final quarter of the game came to very little and Halesowen could have doubled their advantage on 85 minutes when Cowley picked up a loose ball but shot just wide.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Darren</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town:- Coleman, Johnson, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Amos, Cowley (Cooper 88), Lamey (C Smith 79), Forinton, N Smith, Forsdick. Unused subs:- Strachan, Skidmore, Pierpoint</p>
  <p>Chesham United:- Bonfield, Sinclair, Sweeney, Corbould, Bowden-Haase, Polidore (Mapes 84), Byrne (c), Hall, Sippetts, Lawford (B Smith 87), Scarlett. Unused subs:- Dawber, Bateman, Foster</p>
  <p>Booked: Preston 71, Amos 75 Attendance: 386</p>
  <p>An excellent all round performance from Halesowen earnt them 3 valuable points for the first time since August Bank Holiday.</p>
  <p>A bright start by the Yeltz with Cowley swinging in a free kick which was headed just wide. Chesham's Steve Sinclair hit just over on 3 minutes after good work down the left.</p>
  <p>A move between Forsdick and Lamey on 7 minutes allowed Nick Smith to hit a left footed drive which was tipped over by Bonfield. A diagonal pass from Johnson on 9 allowed Forsdick to break clear but he just failed to hit the target as the ball went over.</p>
  <p>Halesowen continued to build on their early pressure, with Forinton driving a shot across the face of the goal on 18 minutes but Forsdick was just unable to reach it. Forsdick again went close a minute later but just over ran the ball after rounding the keeper.</p>
  <p>Forinton seized upon a poor Chesham back pass on 26 but the keeper recovered well to save. Chesham broke clear on 27 minutes but Andre Scarlett's effort was deflected over. Forinton linked up well with Cowley on 29 with Cowley having his left foot shot pushed wide. From the resulting corner Lamey rounded the keeper but his pull back was well defended by Chesham's solid looking rearguard action.</p>
  <p>Another good cross from Cowley was just missed by Nick Smith on 40 minutes, but a minute later following a corner the ball fell to HOWARD FORINTON who played an excellent 1-2 with Steve Pope before scoring his 2nd league goal of the season and put Halesowen into a deserved half time lead.</p>
  <p>From the restart Coleman was called on to tip over from John Lawford as Halesowen were nearly caught cold. Cowley broke clear on 53 minutes but Bowden-Haase recovered to clear the danger. A cross shot from Forinton just missed Lamey at the far post a minute later.</p>
  <p>A through ball from Forsdick allowed Cowley to break free on 58 minutes but the keeper was alert to the danger and cleared the ball for a throw in. Amos headed a Forinton cross over on 65 minutes.</p>
  <p>With Chesham coming in to the game a little more mid way through the second half, Dave Haywood gave a penalty away after pushing the Chesham forward. &#xD;
Graham Hall's right foot shot was excellently saved by Dean Coleman and as the follow up was hit towards the goal Nick Preston handled. The referee only booked Preston but awarded Chesham a second penalty in a minute. This time John Lawford struck a low left foot shot and this time Coleman produced a fantastic save to push the ball over the bar.</p>
  <p>Halesowen recovered from this pressure as Cowley went close on 82 minutes after excellent work on the edge of the box.The resulting corner was headed goalwards by substitute Chris Smith which the keeper did well to save.</p>
  <p>Halesowen held on in the 3 minutes of injury time to get a deserved 3 points.</p>
