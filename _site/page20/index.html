    <h3>Weymouth 4 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The club has released the following press release:</p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Dave Johnson</h3>

  <p>Weymouth: Potter; Cameron, Hale, Hare, Browne, Cross (Funnell 15), Gammon &#xD;
(Spiller 78), Hutchinson (Nicholson 76), Robotham, Underhay, Tilley</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Wood, Owen, Comyn, Ford, Cartwright, Collins, Mansell &#xD;
(Dodd 65), Griffiths (Piggott 61), Payne, Hines. Sub: Lloyd</p>
  <p>Booked: Wood, Hale, Payne, Collins Referee:  B. Baker (Andover) Attendance: 730</p>
  <p>John Chambers resigned as manager of Halesowen Town after two years in &#xD;
charge at The Grove following another disturbing defeat against a Weymouth &#xD;
side without a win and suffering from a number of key injuries.&#xD;
Harry Rudge would have called it a "bad day at Black Rock" with another &#xD;
chapter in the history of HTFC about to close and all the pre-season &#xD;
promise finally turning to ashes.</p>
  <p>One bright spot was the form of goalkeeper Andy Quy who put in an another &#xD;
excellent display for the Yeltz. The tone of play for the afternoon was set &#xD;
in the 5th minute when Quy saved Martin Underhay's 15 yard drive. Quy went &#xD;
on to make further tremendous first half saves from Underhay and Darren &#xD;
Robotham with the visiting defence unable to close down the Weymouth &#xD;
attack. However, Quy had no chance as Weymouth took the lead in the 31st &#xD;
minute with the unmarked Ian Hutchison powerfully heading Anthony Tilley's &#xD;
corner home from 12 yards.</p>
  <p>In truth, apart from some early neat play, Halesowen lacked the &#xD;
organisation or balance to pose a serious threat to Weymouth, registering &#xD;
only one shot on target all afternoon. Ross Collins did well to rob the &#xD;
Weymouth midfield and set up Stuart Payne to easily slot home an equaliser &#xD;
in the 43rd minute.</p>
  <p>The brief period of hope for the Yeltz faithful disappeared as Weymouth &#xD;
took second half control and went back in front after five minutes of the &#xD;
restart. Quy saved Matthew Hare's goalbound drive from Anthony Tilley's &#xD;
freekick but the defence failed to clear the danger and Robotham was able  &#xD;
 to latch onto the rebound.</p>
  <p>John Chambers introduced Garry Piggott for Michael Griffiths and Andy Dodd &#xD;
brought short Craig Mansell's return to Weymouth, but the substitutions &#xD;
failed to breathe life into the Yeltz who fell further behind to two late &#xD;
goals. Matthew Gammon played a neat interchange with Robotham in the 72nd &#xD;
minute and Matthew Hale had the easy task of beating the exposed Quy from &#xD;
close range. It was no surprise when Hale added a fourth goal five minutes &#xD;
from time after being set up by Robotham again as Halesowen's heads dropped &#xD;
in despair at their dreadful start to the new season.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Newport 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    I know my results in  only go back 6 years or so, but I really can't remember such a bad start to the season.

<h3>Match Report from Dave Johnson</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy; Wood, Hines, Comyn, Ford, Cartwright, Crisp, Mansell &#xD;
(Collins 65), Griffiths, Payne, Dodd (Piggott 65). Subs: Owen</p>
  <p>Newport County: Mountain; Robison, Benton, Davies, Kemp, Thorne, Rose, &#xD;
Donovan, Hunt, Sheppard, Flynn (Bale 82). Subs: Beckett, James</p>
  <p>Booked: Collins&#xD;
Referee:  M. Forder (Hereford)&#xD;
Attendance: 532</p>
  <p>Halesowen's dismal start to the season continued as they were well beaten &#xD;
by a lively Welsh outfit. Newport were quick off the mark with Garry &#xD;
Sheppard stabbing the ball just wide in the 5th minute before seeing his &#xD;
shot hit the post three minutes later when Andy Quy in the Halesowen goal &#xD;
failed to gather his shot cleanly. Halesowen were lacking penetration up &#xD;
front but Michael Griffiths did turn to fire a 15 yard shot at Pat Mountain &#xD;
in the 11th minute. Newport's pressure finally paid off in the 39th minute &#xD;
when Dave Hunt lashed home a right wing cross from Matt Rose from 12 yards &#xD;
out in front of a vociferous band of travelling fans.</p>
  <p>Quy made two excellent blocking saves from Hunt and Sheppard as Newport &#xD;
continued to dominate the start of the second half and saved Halesowen's &#xD;
blushes again in the 63rd  minute when Sheppard broke free of the home &#xD;
defence with Jason Donovan and Mike Flynn unable to turn the follow up &#xD;
home. Newport went two goals ahead in the 65th minute when Donovan broke &#xD;
through the heart of the Halesowen defence again but this time made no &#xD;
mistake when clear on goal.</p>
  <p>Halesowen eventually pulled a goal back in the 82nd minute when a free kick &#xD;
from Les Hines was met by the head of Phil Wood at the far post. However, &#xD;
Newport made the points safe three minutes from time when Sheppard turned &#xD;
to drill the ball past Quy from 20 yards.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Margate 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    First point of the season, and we're creeping slightly up the .

<h3>Match Report from Fady</h3>

  <p>Bloody hell! Anyone who saw Clinton miss after ghosting past two defenders and the goal keeper, before shooting wide at Bromsgrove last year will have thought they saw miss of the century. On the evidence of today, not so. At the start of the second half Michael Griffiths broke free from the Margate defence to win a 50-50 ball with their keeper and find himself right in front of the goal with the closest defender 10 yards away and the keeper sprawled on the floor. He had time to sit down and prod it in with his arse. Instead, he tried to place it in the bottom corner and only succeeded in hitting the post, before putting the rebound (which incidentally, you'd have backed Clinton on a bad day to tuck away) wide. Madness.</p>
  <p>And that was the highlight (or lowlight, depending on our viewpoint) of the match. An inept Halesowen display in the first half saw the team leave the pitch to jeers and cries of 'Rubbish'. And to be honest, it was. Free kicks were constantly wasted, balls hoofed into space, and it is a fair comment to say it was like watching a Sunday morning pub side. Margate hit the underside of the bar, not once, but twice, and the Yeltz did not like anything like the side who had been so promising in the pre season games. Needless to say, John Chambers looked a very unhappy man, with a few words to say to his players.</p>
  <p>To be fair, the second half was quite a lot better, but still not brilliant. Griffiths wasted the afore mentioned chance, and Scott Darroch was also unlucky not to open his Yeltz account when a rasping 20 yard drive went just wide. Stuart Payne could also have scored when his shot from the by line was well saved by the keeper, and Halesowen were unfortunate not to score. The defence looked solid, and Les Hines was excellent getting forward. It should prove to be a solid unit in a few games time, especially if you consider four of the back five were playing Conference football last season. However, concerns remain, like the inability to use free kicks effectively, and likewise corners, although, some optimism can be taken out of the match.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Dave Johnson</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Quy, Comyn, Hines, Lloyd, Collins, Cartwright, Crisp, &#xD;
Dutton, Payne, Griffiths, Mason. Subs: Dodds, Thomas, Piggott, Owen, &#xD;
Darroch</p>
  <p>Causeway United: Sidaway, Powell, Taylor, Shilvock, Burley, Hancox, Mole, &#xD;
Wood, Williams, Dixon, Skidmore. Subs: Wilson, Hollis, Lewis, Pestridge, &#xD;
Reeves, Hall, Saunders</p>
  <p>Referee: B. Green (Oldbury)</p>
  <p>Causeway made a lively start and a mix-up at the heart of the Halesowen &#xD;
defence in the 5th minute allowed Simon Dixon to nip in and poke the ball &#xD;
past Andy Quy to give the Grove tenants an early lead. Dixon then blasted &#xD;
high from 20 yards for Causeway before Halesowen's Michael Griffiths shot &#xD;
wide from 20 yards in the 13th minute and then saw his 20th minute header &#xD;
fly over the bar. The Yeltz eventually recovered from their shaky opening &#xD;
and equalised in the 39th minute when Craig Burley upended Michael &#xD;
Griffiths in the box and Richard Crisp tucked away the penalty past Matt &#xD;
Sidaway.</p>
  <p>Halesowen took greater control in the second half following five half-time &#xD;
substitutions and scored the winner in the 49th minute when Gary Piggott &#xD;
stooped to head home a left wing cross from fellow substitute Andy Dodds. &#xD;
Dodds then forced an excellent save from Sidaway in a quick Halesowen &#xD;
break six minutes later before Sidaway was on hand again to hold onto Craig &#xD;
Dutton's drive at the foot of the post on the hour.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Kieron</h3>

  <p>What's Black and Yellow and scares the sh*t of everyone? Apart from Forrest that is. Well the Greater Horntail that came towards me as I was leaving the house certainly has the necessary intimidating credentials. Plays in the right colours too. Did you know such fearsome creatures can cut through sheet metal? Mind you, our midfielders now carry a sting in their tail.</p>
  <p>Tenacious Scouse proffered at the beginning of the game. Belligerent maybe? And these are friendly games. Bring on the Salisbury for a 'mons game.' The pre-season programme is the best we've seen for years.</p>
  <p>Three Conference outfits to test all departments and none has been found severely wanting. Sure there have been faults - Telford's goal was a right cock-up at the back but the promise of our new blokes has more than compensated.</p>
  <p>Slinky skills were once again displayed and some of the movement and passing was tremendous. Scott Darroch was inspired at times - Ralphy was an early benefactor of a superlative display of his ability to shake off close attention and he almost repaid with a brilliant strike which skimmed over the bar. Looking as fit as ever in his first game, Ralphy snuck upfront to receive an audacious flick from Neil Cartwright who seemed to be relishing the contest with his old team.</p>
  <p>Fortuitous maybe but Ralph managed to lob the flailing keeper who was caught off guard. The scorching weather put paid to a second half slog and most players wished they were on the touchline with the subs soaking up the sunshine. Hope someone's taped these games for John Chambers.</p>

    <h3>Margate 3 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It was a beautiful day by the seaside, we were all dressed up in silly costumes but unfortunately a football match broke out. Luckily nobody seemed too bothered and we went down 3-1 on the slopiest pitch since we flattened The Grove many years ago.</p>
  <p>We were missing quite a few players, went behind but then equalised through Cartwright in about the 10th minute of injury time whilst most people had already gone to the bar. They were a pretty decent team, and whilst we never really looked like adding to our score they always looked threatening and deserved their victory.</p>
  <p>
    So we ended up smack in the middle of the table in  with a nicely symmetrical 14 wins, 14 draws and 14 losses. Hurrah!

  <p>Obviously the site won't be updated as regularly through the summer, but I'll try and bring you any news that I know whenever I can. Enjoy Euro 2000, and let's hope for a successful season next year.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Margate: Turner, Saunders, O'Brien, Martin, O'Connell, Dixon, Munday, &#xD;
Edwards, Greatorex (Takalogabashi 64), Collins (Lamb 78), Williams. Subs: &#xD;
Lamb, Takalogabashi, Blackford.</p>

  <p>Halesowen ended their tenth season of Premier football with a disappointing &#xD;
defeat at the hands of third placed Margate despite their fans partying in &#xD;
traditional end of season fancy dress.</p>
  <p>Halesowen soon came under pressure when stand-in goalkeeper Scott Turbutt &#xD;
failed to hold Eliot Martin's 7th minute corner but his defence scrambled &#xD;
clear Tony Dixon's header. Clinton Thomas then headed against his own &#xD;
crossbar from another left wing corner kick as he attempted to clear. &#xD;
Margate finally made the breakthrough five minutes before the interval when &#xD;
Mark Greatorex pounced on indecision by Wayne Lloyd to slot past Turbutt.</p>
  <p>In a rare break up the slope, Neil Cartwright equalised for Halesowen on &#xD;
the stroke of half time with a low 12 yard drive which eluded Lee Turner in &#xD;
the Gate goal.</p>
  <p>Margate quickly regained the lead in the 48th minute when Turbutt spilt &#xD;
another left wing cross allowing Iain O'Connell to fire home the loose ball &#xD;
from 15 yards. Lee Williams then saw his headed goal disallowed for offside &#xD;
but with Margate well on top the third goal arrived after 65 minutes with &#xD;
Phil Collins heading home a right wing corner from Jay Saunders.</p>
  <p>Manager John Chambers sent on Stuart Payne and Scott Gennard to bolster &#xD;
Halesowen's attack in the 66th minute, but Margate were able to coast to &#xD;
victory against the understrength Yeltz.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Adam Clarke</h3>

  <p>We played poorly at the start of the game. We were disappointed when they scored but were pleased when the team started to play better.&#xD;
The second and third goals we scored were brilliant and we deserved the goals and we were unlucky for them to equalize in the last minute.</p>
  <p>Let's hope we get better in the new season and it is good news that the season ticket prices have not gone up for children. Thanks to everyone at Halesowen Town for the free match at the weekend!</p>

  <p>Happy Halesowen bagged their eighth Easter goal to extend their remarkable &#xD;
end-of-season flourish with a comprehensive victory at second placed &#xD;
Burton.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz signalled their intentions after 11 minutes when experienced &#xD;
play-maker Paul Birch netted from a tight angle after Nick Goodwin parried &#xD;
Ian Reed's volley, but the goal was disallowed for offside. Burton &#xD;
gradually came into the game and the alert Danny McDonnell made two fine &#xD;
blocking saves from Christian Moore before Halesowen took charge to build a &#xD;
three goal lead.</p>
  <p>In the 30th minute, Birch played a lovely ball for Ian Aldridge to lob the &#xD;
Burton keeper, but the defensive clearance fell for Clinton Thomas to &#xD;
cleverly rifle home from 10 yards. Thomas and Reed then went close as the &#xD;
visitors turned up the pressure with Aldridge causing confusion for the &#xD;
Burton defence. Halesowen extended their lead three minutes before the &#xD;
break with a wicked 20 yard  Birch volley following Reed's corner.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz should have gone further ahead in the 58th minute when Reed's &#xD;
free kick struck the arm of Darren Stride and the referee awarded a &#xD;
penalty, but Reed's tame spot-kick was easily saved by Goodwin. With Burton &#xD;
struggling to make any impression, it was no surprise when Thomas powered &#xD;
in his second goal in the 73rd minute from another precise midfield pass &#xD;
from Birch.</p>
  <p>Halesowen almost unwound their good work when a hesitant defence watched a &#xD;
David Holmes left wing cross sail directly into the net in the 77th. minute &#xD;
and just two minutes later player manager Nigel Clough drilled home from &#xD;
the edge of the area, watched from the stands by famous father Brian.</p>
  <p>Agile Aldridge made the points safe for Halesowen in the 88th minute when &#xD;
he nipped in between the defence and goalkeeper Goodwin to net with a neat &#xD;
chip.</p>

    <h3>King's Lynn 1 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After 5 unbeaten games that's taken us to the brink of safety, the rejuvenated Yeltz lost 1-0 away at King's Lynn. Despite having a good majority of the play, without wonderchild Ian Aldridge we struggled to convert our possession into goals and went down to a King's Lynn winner just after half-time.</p>
  <p>In other games, losses for Rothwell and Atherstone (6-0 at Grantham) means those two will now definitely finish in the relegation zone - I hesitate to say are relegated after what's happened over the last few seasons. At the top, Boston still need a couple of points to finally clinch a well deserved title.</p>
  <p>Just four games left now, starting with the visit of in-trouble Gloucester to The Grove on Saturday. A win for us would definitely make us safe and would just about send them down so it should be an "interesting" affair.</p>

    <h3>Cambridge City 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    After an amazing run of four wins, to be honest it's disappointing we only drew with Cambridge City. I guess that shows how much we've improved over the last few weeks. We're now up to  in the league and almost mathematically safe from relegation.

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Cambridge City: Davies, Wenlock, Coburn, Holden, Randall, Pincher, Reeder&#xD;
(Wilde 63), Tovey, Taylor (Cleaver 80), Cambridge, Salmons. Subs: Gawthrop,&#xD;
Wilde, Cleaver.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: McDonnell, Brown, Owen (Cooper 45), Lloyd, Smith, Gardiner,&#xD;
Birch, Aldridge, Thomas, Cartwright, Reed. Subs: Gennard, Collins, Cooper</p>
  <p>Referee:  D. Whitestone (Northants.) Attendance: 328</p>
  <p>Revitalised Halesowen enjoyed long spells of possession in the first half&#xD;
but lacked the killer touch in front of goal to secure victory and were&#xD;
ultimately forced to settle for a point.</p>
  <p>For the home side, Ian Cambridge beat Wayne Lloyd to the ball in the 21st&#xD;
minute, but Danny McDonnell was on hand to turn his effort away for a&#xD;
corner before Adam Salmons aimed a fierce diving header wide of the mark&#xD;
following an excellent cross from Neil Coburn three minutes later.</p>
  <p>In a flowing move with cross field interchanges between Jason Owen and Paul&#xD;
Birch, Halesowen's Ian Aldridge successfully lobbed goalkeeper Martin&#xD;
Davies in the 24th. minute but his effort struck the top of the crossbar.&#xD;
Three minutes later Aldridge's first time volley fell just wide after&#xD;
Davies had punched clear under pressure from Clinton Thomas.</p>
  <p>The visitors took the lead in the 38th minute after persistence from Ashley&#xD;
Brown allowed him to deliver an excellent right wing cross which was headed&#xD;
home by Thomas. With the home side pinned back in their own half, Steve&#xD;
Holden cleared Ian Reed's drive off the line and Davies tipped Wayne&#xD;
Lloyd's close range header over the bar before the half-time interval.</p>
  <p>Cambridge levelled in the 55th. minute when Player Manager Chris Tovey&#xD;
headed home a high cross in a crowded goalmouth. Halesowen's Neil&#xD;
Cartwright was then unlucky to see his 72nd. minute drive rebound into&#xD;
safety off the crossbar after his surging run from midfield and Matt&#xD;
Gardiner's drive into the net was ruled offside.</p>
  <p>The home side almost stole the points two minutes from time when substitute&#xD;
Chris Cleaver beat the offside trap and place the ball beyond McDonnell in&#xD;
the Halesowen goal, but Adrian Cooper raced back to scoop the ball over the&#xD;
bar.</p>
