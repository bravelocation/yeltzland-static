    <h3>Yeltz 1 Havant 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Unfortunately I'm in the USA on business this week so the usual slightly out-of-date coverage may be even slower. This also means I'm even more dependent on you lot to send me match reports, details, gossip etc. so just &#xD;
 <a href="mailto:poll@yeltzland.net">mail me</a>  at the usual address and I'll try and get stuff up ASAP.</p>
  <p>All I do know is good - a fourth straight win - this time at home to Havant with a goal from young superstar Ian Aldridge, and we're up to a much healthier 11th place. Hurrah!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Mark Holt</h3>

  <p>And so our run stretches to an incredible 4 games won. The goal came in the&#xD;
first 10 minutes when a header from Clinton hit the bar and the ball fell&#xD;
kindly to Ian Aldridge who couldn't miss from a couple of yards out. Then a&#xD;
few minutes later Aldo missed a rebound from a saved Clinton shot. The next&#xD;
30 minutes passed with little action(I think).</p>
  <p>The second half started like&#xD;
the first had ended but it sprung back into action when "Our Ashley" had a&#xD;
dipping shot from a tight angle which hit the bar. Then Clinton missed a&#xD;
shot from 5 yards out after a well worked freekick. However this was nothing&#xD;
compared to the fun which was had by all when Salvatore Bibbo (is his name&#xD;
better than Chuck Martini's?) handled a Ian Aldridge lob which seemed sure&#xD;
to be finished by Aldo. Bibbo was sent off for this offence and for the last&#xD;
10 minutes an outfield player had to take his place (not sure of the blokes&#xD;
name). From the resulting freekick (incidentally the wall was never 10 yards&#xD;
cos the freekick was taken on the very edge of the 18 yard-box with the wall&#xD;
standing a yard behind the penalty spot which means the wall was surely only&#xD;
7 yards). The replacement keeper saved well for a defender from the&#xD;
freekick. Although this result means we are in 11th place we surely deserved&#xD;
to win this one about 3-0.</p>

  <p>It's taken some time, but the mighty Yeltz have finally hit some form with three excellent wins in the league. &#xD;
	The latest victory was another away victory against a team near the top of the table, a 2-1 win at Tamworth. Goals from&#xD;
	Richard Crisp and returning favourite Ian Reed before the break means we're now 10 points above the drop zone and&#xD;
	in a healthy  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=01042000"&gt;12th place</a>  in the table.</p>

    <h3>Bath 0 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>What a fantastic signing! Two goals in two victorious games from new bloke Ian Aldridge and we can start to 	breathe a little easier.</p>
  <p>Bath had lost their last two games, but this shouldn't take anything away from a crucial and to be honest unexpected victory. Boston look a shoe-in for the title now - Bath are 14 points behind with only two games in hand - but more importantly we're now 7 points clear of that last relegation spot.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings another difficult away game at Tamworth, but we go there in much better heart now. Come On!</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 Salisbury 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>With only a second league win since the New Year, the mighty Yeltz finally looked like a half-decent team again with a stirring second-half display against Salisbury.</p>
  <p>Two goals from  <b>Crispy</b>  (one a very dubious penalty) and the other from promising young  <b>new bloke Ian Aldridge</b>  led to three crucial points in the relegation battle - points that were made even more crucial after Merthyr, Grantham and Dorchester all won as well. Full details in my  match report .</p>
  <p>Two tough away games coming up - on Tuesday at title-chasing  <b>Bath</b> , and then on Saturday a battle against  <b>Tamworth</b> . These are probably our toughest games left, so any points gained here will be a bonus.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Poll</h3>

  <p>I'll do the team bit first: McDonnell, Brown, Wood, Gardiner, Owen, Crisp, Cartwright, Smith, Birch, Thomas, Aldridge Subs: Gennard, Cooper, Another one</p>
  <p>This was the team that a lot of us have been asking for - Hash Brown returning at right back lets Crispy push forward more - a role he is much better suited to - and Cartwright in midfield to keep the ball on the ground a bit. This more attacking policy definitely paid dividends, especially in the second half.</p>
  <p>It was the smallest crowd I think I've ever seen at The Grove for a real game, and the atmosphere (in the first half at least) was awful. We started off reasonably well with new bloke wonderkid Ian Aldridge, just arrived on the No. 9 from Cradley, showing some good movement and a nice touch on the ball. However, unsurprisingly we looked very short of confidence and not a lot happened in the first half. Crispy fired into the sidenetting from 18 yards, and Danny was lucky to stay on from a very generous ref - see later - when he brought down their forward on the edge of the box when right through after a mix up with Ash Brown.</p>
  <p>The second half started much like the first, but then sprung into life when *b*Crispy*cb* nipped in between defender and keeper to force in the first. The Shed finally burst into life, and the world suddenly started to look a much better place. &#xD;
Smiles were even broader a few minutes later when big Clinton battled to win the ball in the corner and then put over a perfect cross to let *b*new bloke*cb* place a lovely header into the bottom corner for a debut goal.</p>
  <p>The ref then put a dampener on things by giving them a penalty from what looked like absolutely nothing &#xD;
(I had a brilliant view 80 yards away) but he soon made amends by returning the complement and giving us a penalty for nothing. Crispy was right through but their keeper timed his run perfectly, dived at his feet and won the ball brilliantly. Whatever. Crispy calmly fired it home and we were just about safe.</p>
  <p>The Jolly Boys then had much amusement at the hapless refs expense, especially when Crispy made a theatrical dive in the box with a broad grin on his face, and for once we could go home happy. Hurrah!</p>

    <p>
  <p>Only a friendly today to give the players Mr Chambers doesn't like a run out. We won 5-0 as if that means anything.</p>
  <p>More importantly, the other league results have dropped us to a brilliant  <b> 17th position </b> . I don't think the results went too badly for us, with Crawley (who are on a tremendous run) beating Dorchester (who are as bad as us) and Atherstone losing as well (don't they always?).</p>

    <p>
  <p>Very very very poor. Losing 1-0 at home to Atherstone not only gave them some hope of saving themselves, &#xD;
but missed a crucial opportunity of hauling themselves away from the danger zone. &#xD;
With Grantham winning again, we are in big, big trouble.</p>
  <p>Well enough of you have asked for it, so although it's not the most positive of things to vote on, &#xD;
you can now register your thoughts on how the manager is doing.</p>
  <p>No game on Saturday - although the Yeltzline mentions a possible friendly at home to Tividale - &#xD;

    <h3>Crawley 2 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Another hard-earned point away to a fellow relegation struggler, and we're just about keeping our heads above water.</p>
  <p>The welcome return of  <b>Clinton Thomas</b>  meant we actually had a forward who might actually score, and  <b>two goals</b>  from the big man keeps us in  15th place  now three points above that last relegation place held by a rapidly fading Gloucester.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already checked out the  <b> <a href="http://go.to/clintonline">Clinton Thomas</a>  web site</b> , now might be a good time to do it.</p>
  <p>Two more crucial games coming up - this time at home.

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Crawley Town: Little, Doherty, Payne, Taylor, Ugbah, Hurdle (Vines 90), Pullan, Sharman, Wordsworth, Moore (Best 74), Lovett. Subs: Johnson, Best, Vines</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: McDonnell, Collins, Owen, Wood, Lloyd, Gardiner, Crisp, Gennard (Blake 69), Thomas, Smith, Cooper. Subs: Birch, Blake, Brown</p>
  <p>Booked: Sharman, Doherty, Gennard, Hurdle, Lovett, Taylor, Gardiner Referee: A. Wooldridge (Ashington) Attendance: 706</p>
  <p>Halesowen were full value for a point at fellow strugglers Crawley with Clinton Thomas leading the frontline by notching two goals on his return from injury.</p>
  <p>Referee Andrew Wooldridge stamped his authority early on by cautioning two Crawley players in the first 4 minutes and went on to book seven players in total. Danger-man Thomas caused considerable problems for Crawley and with his back to goal he turned defender Ian Payne in the 11th minute to force a fine save from Andy Little. Thomas eventually opened the scoring for Halesowen after 18 minutes by wrong-footing the Crawley defence before firing into the bottom corner of the net. However, the Yeltz held the lead for just two minutes when their defence appeared to freeze allowing Dean Wordsworth to break clear and slot home easily past Danny McDonnell in the 20th minute. Neil Smith, Richard Crisp and Ross Collins all fired long range efforts just wide of the Crawley goal as Halesowen enjoyed considerable possession just before the break, but it was Crawley who took the lead after 56 minutes when Jay Lovett's corner was touched home from close range by captain John Ugbah after a goalmouth scramble.</p>
  <p>Halesowen battled back and produced an equaliser of breathtaking pace and quality on 66 minutes when Neil Smith played the ball out to the left wing for Adrian Cooper to deliver a perfectly timed cross for the incoming Thomas to connect with a one-touch sidefoot past Little. Thomas headed over the bar after 70 minutes whilst searching for his hat-trick, but in stoppage time it was Crawley who almost stole the points when Lionel Best's cross dissected the visiting defence, but substitute Francis Vines was unable to find a final touch.</p>

  <p>We didn't score and we've still only won once this century, but the mighty Yeltz gained a gratefully received point at fellow strugglers Worcester.</p>
  <p>The next few days brings games against fellow strugglers Crawley and Atherstone. Crawley have climbed out of relegation zone with some excellent results recently, and Atherstone won their first game since September (and we thought we were bad) today against Ilkeston.</p>

  <p>We were never going to win them, but two losses against the league leaders has brought us to <b>a critical time of the season</b> only two points above the relegation zone.</p>
  <p>The next 8 days brings games against fellow strugglers Worcester, Crawley and Atherstone.

  <p>On a happier note, a lot of us were out in Seville for Yeltz fan and Fantasy Island reigning champion Sean Jackson's wedding. I'm sure everyone would like to join me in wishing Sean and Reyes all the best for the future, and let's hope he can improve his defence of the title now the wedding's over :-)</p>

    <h3>Boston 4 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Well it wasn't totally unexpected, but the manner of the defeat at league leaders Boston was very disappointing.</p>
  <p>3-0 down at the break following some pretty poor defending, things didn't get much better when Cartwright was &#xD;
	sent off for elbowing an opponent in the face. After that, we held them pretty well and even got one back with a &#xD;
	long-range effort from Ada Cooper, but they got a fourth near the end.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Ken Fox from the  <a href="http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/primavera/boston/">Boston web site</a> , we've got a couple of&#xD;
	video clips of goals from the game. See my  match report for details</p>
  <p>We're still in 13th place , but we're now only 3 points above rapidly improving Crawley in that last relegation place, and we're not exactly the form team at the moment.</p>
  <p>There's no game for a couple of weeks now until the visit of title-chasing Bath to The Grove. Things are looking good, aren't they :-(</p>

  <p>Merthyr had been on an equally poor run, which makes it doubly disappointing, although from what I've heard&#xD;

  <p>On an extremely windy day, the Yeltz battled to a much needed point away at Clevedon. &#xD;
	The weather ruined the game, but they've had a pretty good record at home so it's not too bad.</p>
  <p> The table  makes pretty worrying reading. The bottom 3 are really struggling,&#xD;
	but we're only 6 points above Crawley who hold that last relegation spot. The next two games, at HOME to Newport and&#xD;
	Merthyr are looking very important.</p>

being replaced by Robbie Slater. This seems particularly unlikely to me, but if anything happens as usual this site&#xD;
will bring you the news a couple of days late :-)</p>
  <p>I believe we have signed Steve Taylor, a forward and semi-pro international from Kiddy. With Ian Olney and Evran back in retirement, I reckon&#xD;
that takes our fit strike force back up to 3.</p>

  <p>So close. In a fluctuating battle against Conference side Doncaster, the mighty Yeltz lost by the &#xD;

  <p>The game kicked off 45 minutes late, and was goalless until  <b>Donny took the lead</b>  just after half-time. However we soon struck&#xD;

    <p>
  <p>In a fantastic battling performance, the mighty Yeltz earned a deserved replay with a &#xD;
	 <b>1-1 draw against Doncaster.</b> </p>
  <p>It was a scrappy first half, with Birchy, thankfully returning in midfield, influential but with no real chances at&#xD;
	either end. Then the vocal Yeltz following were rewarded by a goal from new bloke <b>Ian Olney,</b>  who coolly lifted&#xD;
	his shot over the advancing keeper.</p>
  <p>The lead lasted about 10 minutes, until they equalised with a spectacular effort for outside the box, and the&#xD;

  <p>The replay's on Tuesday night at The Grove. Let's hope for a large and vocal support - we can do it!</p>

    <h3>BSC  Boldmere 2 Yeltz 1 (AET)</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Genius. There's no point wasting effort on these local competitions when we've got the Trophy to concentrate on.</p>
  <p>Boldmere took the lead in the 81st minute, before Stuart Payne equalised almost immediately. This meant extra-time&#xD;
	(just what we wanted) and unfortunately a last minute winner for the home team.</p>
  <p>No need to remind you about the big one on Saturday - our 3rd Round FA Trophy game away to Conference side Doncaster.&#xD;
	COME ON!!!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Darren Marklew</h3>

  <p>Do you allow double figure scores in Fantasy Island?.</p>
  <p>This wasn't the greatest result before possibly the biggest game of the season&#xD;
(assuming we escape a relegation battle!). Yet again Danny saved us on several&#xD;
occasions but in all fairness we had two shots on target in 120 minutes and&#xD;
Boldmere deserved there win..</p>
  <p>The chap who gives Ashley Brown a lift to the matches (Jason Donovan or&#xD;
something like that!) played on the left and considering nobody has a clue who&#xD;
he is, he didn't do badly before being taken off for Jason Owen! Roll on&#xD;
Doncaster and lets hope we win 4-1 (cos I might predict that!).</p>
  <p>The team was : McDonnell; Brown; Donovan; Wood; Lloyd; Gardiner; Collins; Payne;&#xD;
Gennard; Cartwright; Crisp.</p>
  <p>Attendance: really was one man and his dog!</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Tamworth 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Very disappointing. The first home game of the century brought local rivals  <b>Tamworth</b>  to The Grove,&#xD;
	where they gave us a comprehensive 3-0 roasting. Not the best of warm-ups for next week's big Trophy game&#xD;
	at Doncaster.</p>
  <p>This week brought another new forward to The Grove -  <b>Ian Olney</b> , formerly of Villa and Kiddy amongst other places.&#xD;
	Let's hope he'll soon be knocking them in, as we're still looking for a consistent finisher to replace old Pie-arce.</p>
  <p>The  <b>B'ham Senior Cup game at Boldmere</b>  has been rearranged to this  <b>Tuesday</b> &#xD;
	(7.30pm kickoff) before the big one	next Saturday.</p>

    <h3>Gloucester 2 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>First of all I'd like to wish everyone a  <b>Happy New Year,</b> especially those of you who've just&#xD;
	found us on your lovely new Xmas computers.</p>
  <p>It might be a new millennium, but I'm afraid the coverage here will be as up-to-date as ever :-(&#xD;
	However our first game of the century resulted in a very creditable  <b>2-2 draw</b>  away to old rivals &#xD;
	 <b>Gloucester City.</b> Goals from  <b>Cooper</b>  and  <b>Payne</b>  extended our unbeaten run &#xD;
	(in the League) to 5 games.</p>
  <p>Don't forget, if you were at the game and would like to add your opinion on what happened, why not send in&#xD;
	a match report? </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Andrew Simpson</h3>

  <p>On a cold and wet January afternoon the game got off to a stuttering start with niggly tackles &#xD;
and some dodgy decisions going against us. The game never got going until Gloucester made the breakthrough on &#xD;
44 minutes with a tap in. Halesowen replied instantly, Crispy crossing a great ball which Ada Cooper slotted home.</p>
  <p>The second half started well with another Crispy cross was slotted home cooly by Stuart Payne to make it 2-1,&#xD;
and he could have made it three when he slotted the ball wide in a one to one with the Tigers 'keeper Ryan Gallaway.&#xD;
The Yeltz hung on for 35 minutes with the Meadow Park pitch not helping City's attack with the ball sticking in the mud on &#xD;
numerous occasions. The Gloucester breakthrough finally came when the home side's number 4 headed home. &#xD;
The game finished in a skirmish with Wayne Lloyd killing almost all the home side!</p>
  <p>Team: McDonnell, Crisp, Owen, Wood, Lloyd, Collins, Wright, Payne, Gennard, Cooper, Smith - &#xD;
Subs (not used) Brown, Cartwright, Donavan</p>
