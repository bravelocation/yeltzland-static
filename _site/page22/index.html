    <h3>Yeltz 2 Burton 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Hope everyone had a Merry Xmas - I think we all got one of the presents we wanted with a 2-1 victory&#xD;
	over Burton.</p>
  <p>I'm still on me hols so I'm afraid I know nothing but the scoreline at the moment - &#xD;
	normal service should be resumed after the  <b>Gloucester game on the 3rd</b>  (kickoff 3pm).</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Mark Wheatley</h3>

  <p>An excellent game for the Xmas season with  a terrific result for Halesowen.</p>
  <p>After Burton had the better of the opening minutes Yeltz took the lead after the ball was driven across the face of goal&#xD;
by Scott Gennard. Scott was involved in the secong goal when he cleverly chipped back across goal for Adrian Cooper&#xD;
to head home. Shortly afterwards Cooper missed a hanging volley which could have settled the game. &#xD;
It was then Burton who went close and forced a great save from Danny low down at the post. &#xD;
Their best chance was a volley which was blazed over.</p>
  <p>The second half was a rear guard action except for a one on one for Cooper but the keeper made a good save.&#xD;
Burton finally got a goal and the final 30 minutes was a seige but good defending and a FANTASTIC save from &#xD;
Danny when one on one ensured that the 3 points remained at The Grove and sent the Albion fans&#xD;
probably feeling that they deserved a share of the spoils. My MOTM Danny - outstanding.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 King's Lynn 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Well there was a lot of effort without any real quality, and on a freezing-cold day, some excellent goalkeeping&#xD;
	on both sides led to a 0-0 draw.</p>
  <p>The front two (Clinton and Payne) toiled hard without getting any decent service from midfield where young Birch&#xD;
	was missing, and their central defenders soaked up just about everything that went their way. Danny made several brilliant&#xD;
	saves to keep us in it, although the best chances of the game fell to new bloke Scott Gennard (poked just wide)&#xD;
	and Payney (he blocked the keeper's clearance but couldn't force it home).</p>
  <p> <b>The Boldmere on Tuesday in the B'ham Senior was called off again,</b> &#xD;
	so our next games are now on the  <b>27th at home to Burton</b>  (3pm kickoff) and then &#xD;
	 <b>away to Gloucester on the 3rd</b>  (also 3pm).</p>
  <p>I'm away over Xmas and New Year, so  <b>I'm afraid the site will be updated even later than usual</b>  &#xD;

<h3>Match Report from Travis Bickle</h3>

  <p>
    So cold, so very very cold. And with a result as boring as this it really &#xD;
was cold. The first half began well with a Neil Smith(?) header hitting the &#xD;
bar and the ensuing scramble failed to result in a goal. Kings Lynn then &#xD;
dominated the half with Danny keeping us in the game with a couple of good &#xD;
saves. In the last 5 minutes of the half a 35 yard shot from Matty Gardiner &#xD;
was well saved by Martini (shaken not stirred?).
    
      <i>(I thought it was Wayne Lloyd - ed)</i>
    
  </p>
  <p>The second half was possibly the dullest 45 minutes of football I have ever &#xD;
seen with neither side taking any advantage due to a pudding of a pitch and &#xD;
a pudding of a ref. When Clinton's knee got done in again it appeared a &#xD;
nil-nil would be the result. His replacement Scott Gennard (one for the &#xD;
future) went close, but shot wide from 12 yards. We may well have got the &#xD;
winner when a clearance from Martini hit Payne, but he failed to score from &#xD;
such an acute angle. It's games like these which make me wonder why I ever &#xD;
bother to turn up every other week.</p>

<h3>Match Report from Doc</h3>

  <p>Poll, you bloody part timer</p>
  <p>I managed the jaunt from Barnet to Burton and gosh was it worth it? (No). We lost 3-2.</p>
  <p>We went 1-0 up with a great run and curling shot from Birchy and generally played &#xD;
very well in the first half. Having said that, we were lucky to go in 1 up, &#xD;
as Burton missed a penalty shortly after we'd scored. We were knocking the ball about really well and looked &#xD;
the better team. Woody was all over one of their blokes as he ran into the box and the linesman gave a reasonably valid pen.&#xD;
Matt Siddaway had no probs with the save though, diving to his right to stop a tame effort.</p>
  <p>Er, then they scored 3 times in the first 7 minutes of the second half. Birchy and Crispy went off injured at half time, replaced by &#xD;
Darren Wright and Ashley Brown and we lost all creativity. Their first was a bullet header from a cross and the &#xD;
second two were after mazy runs through our by now non-existent midfield.</p>
  <p>We battled well-ish after this but we never really created anything, oh, &#xD;
apart from when Payney scored with 5 minutes to go. &#xD;
Not even the late arrival of Ross "the new Elmeshinio" Collins could do anything and we lost 3-2.</p>
  <p>Tosh, posh, trussock and fourpence. Bloody stupid competition anyway.</p>

    <p>
  <p>There was a lot of talk at the start of the season of Worcester being favourites for promotion.&#xD;
	I don't think our performance so far has been much to gloat about, but whereas  <b>we're solidly in mid-table,</b> &#xD;

  <p>An early penalty and a 70th minute winner from top scorer  <b>Richard Crisp</b> &#xD;

<h3>Match Report from James Pearson</h3>

  <p>Same Old Story (or ******* awful to quote John Chambers)</p>
  <p>On a cold night at Evesham there was more interest in the passing trains than in a lacklustre Halesowen performance typical of so many against lower division sides. Having said that a win is a win so we live to fight on (and hopefully play some football!) in the next round.</p>
  <p>With no Clinton or Evron in the side you had to wonder where the goals would come from and that was pretty much how the first half went. A drab affair with little football, they scored from a good break down the left by their no. 3 who crossed the ball for a simple goal.  A hopeful punt into the box saw their keeper challenge Neil Smith (at least I think it was Neil Smith but I may have been mistaken - it must have been a mirage) in the box and concede a penalty. It was not a penalty by any stretch of the imagination but never turn down a bad decision!! Crispy fired it low and to the goalkeepers right but to maintain justice he flung himself down well and saved it.</p>
  <p>We looked brighter in the second half but then again we would have struggled not to. Standing behind the dugout gives a whole new impression of management, anyone with any more motivating alternatives to the phrases ******* awful or ******* useless should contact John Chambers urgently. If it had been a fly on the wall BBC documentary then the only clip they could have used was "Payney in the middle NOW" (repeated several hundred times). Bringing on Birch and Collins about 20mins into the half turned the game They linked instantly to test the keeper and within a couple of minutes Collins buried a ball from the left to put us on level terms. While a relief the score still flattered us with Evesham still creating good chances but causing more danger to the cafe queue than Danny with their finishing.  With only seconds remaining there was a steady migration to find a hot drink with the dread of extra time seeming a certainty when an aimless ball into the box was somehow forced home by Collins (at the time I couldn't tell who got the last kick but I gather Collins hit it).</p>
  <p>Star player: Couldn't be really anyone else but Collins however Ashley Brown made some good runs on the right and could have been a contender with more consistency.</p>
  <p>Anyway things will look brighter at the Stourbridge Road End on Saturday when we can all look forward to a well mannered polite game against Worcester - or should we all be putting spread bets on the number of yellow cards now ????</p>

    <h3>Merthyr 1 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After starting to put a decent run together, we've now lost two 1-0 away games on the trot.</p>
  <p>We were on the pools for the first time for ages because most games had been rearranged because of the&#xD;
		Scotland-England game. I'm not sure how many of you decided to loyally make the trip down to Wales, &#xD;
		but I'm sure the rest of us part-timers would appreciate it if you sent in a match report.</p>
  <p>A little bit of good news is that  <b>Stuart Payne</b>  has been signed from Kiddy after a successful loan period,&#xD;
		and we've also signed midfielder  <b>Neil Cartwright</b> , who's previously been at Telford, Kiddy and the Albion.</p>
  <p>Contrary to what I might have said earlier, the  <b>League Cup game against Evesham is away, and this Tuesday (16th)</b> .&#xD;
		Apologies if anyone was misled, but I wouldn't depend on any information you find on this site :-)</p>

<h3>Match Report from Kev Without Trev</h3>

  <p>AS ONE OF THE VERY FEW WHO BOTHERED TO GO, I GUESS IT'S&#xD;
MY DUTY TO WRITE A REPORT. THE LAST TIME OUR SUPPORT &#xD;
WAS OUT-NUMBERED BY THE COMMITTEE WAS A COLD THURSDAY NIGHT IN GRETNA AND LIKEWISE THE TRAVELLERS &#xD;
ON SATURDAY NOW HAVE A CLAIM TO FAME.  WE WERE THERE&#xD;
WHEN OUR SUBS BENCH WAS ANNOUNCED AS WRIGHT, WRIGHT&#xD;
AND CARTWRIGHT. THE REST OF THE TEAM WAS AS FOLLOWS:-</p>
  <p>DANNY,&#xD;
LLOYDY, WOODY, GARDS, JASE,&#xD;
BROWN, BIRCHY, SMITHY, CRISPY,&#xD;
CLINTON, PAYNEY.</p>
  <p>THE GAME STARTED IN CONTRAVERSY BEFORE I HAD EVEN WALKED AROUND THE BACK OF THE STAND.  LLOYDY APPARENTLY HAD TAKEN &#xD;
OUT THEIR RED HOT MARKSMAN MITCHEL AND GOT HIM CARRIED OFF WITHOUT BEING BOOKED, WHICH WAS NICE!  IT SOON BECAME APPARENT &#xD;
THAT THE REF HAD LEFT HIS CARDS AT HOME AS THERE WAS NO END OF TICKING OFFS WITHOUT A CAUTION IN SIGHT.</p>
  <p>MERTHYR HAD THE BEST OF THE FIRST HALF BUT NEVER LOOKED LIKE GETTING PAST DANNY.  WE DID NOT LOOK SHARP AND JUST LIKE &#xD;
TUESDAY WERE FAR TOO CAUTIOUS IN THE EARLY STAGES. OUR ATTACKING PLAY REVOLVED AROUND OVER THE TOP BALLS FOR CLINTON TO &#xD;
CHASE WITH PAYNEY ON HAND TO PICK UP THE SCRAPS.</p>
  <p>JUST ON THE STROKE OF HALF TIME PAYNEY BROKE CLEAR OF THEIR DEFENCE WHO LOOKED A MILE OFFSIDE TO ME, &#xD;
BUT SHOT EMBARASSINGLY WIDE WITH ONLY THE KEEPER TO BEAT. WE LOST CLINTON AT THE START OF THE SECOND HALF WITH A &#xD;
KICK ON HIS ALREADY INJURED KNEE.  EVRAN WAS THE REPLACEMENT AND WE STARTED TO LOOK AT LITTLE MORE DANGEROUS.</p>
  <p>THEY WENT AHEAD HOWEVER ON AROUND 70 MINUTES, SLIGHTLY AGAINST THE RUN OF PLAY, WITH A LUCKY TWICE DEFLECTED SHOT.  &#xD;
THIS FORCED US TO BE MORE ADVENTUROUS. HOWEVER, THEY SOAKED UP THE PRESSURE, EVRAN COMING  CLOSEST WITH A HEADER CLEARED &#xD;
OFF THE LINE IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES.</p>
  <p>GENERALLY, WE ARE LOOKING TO DEFEND RESULTS TOO MUCH AND ARE GIVING THE OPPOSITION MORE RESPECT THAN THEY DESERVE. &#xD;
THE GAME SEEMED TO BE CRYING OUT FOR SOME OF ADA COOPER'S PENETRATING LEFT-HAND RUNS INTO THE BOX BUT, &#xD;
FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, HE WAS DROPPED COMPLETELY BY CHAMBERS.</p>
  <p>AFTER THE WHISTLE, LLOYDY CAME UNDER A TORRENT OF ABUSE FROM THEIR FANS AND NUMEROUS THREATS WERE MADE TO HIM.  &#xD;
UNFORTUNATELY, THE COACH LEFT AT 5.15 PM, SO I WAS UNABLE TO FIND OUT IF ANY OF THE THREATS WERE CARRIED OUT.</p>

    <p>
  <p>The end of a good run but unfortunately there's a reasonable chance it won't matter at the end of the season.</p>
  <p>Grantham are in severe financial difficulties, and it could well have been their last&#xD;
			game ever (you can read all about it at the &#xD;
			 <a href="http://www.cheiron.demon.co.uk/gtfc/">Grantham web site</a>  if you're interested) as they are on the verge&#xD;
			of bankruptcy. If they do go under, I guess the game will be annulled, but we really don't want that to happen -&#xD;
			and for the more one-eyed of you out there, don't forget we'd lose the three points we gained earlier in the year.</p>
  <p>I don't have any details of the game as yet, but hopefully some of you will send a &#xD;
		 match report  to fill the rest of us in</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Darren Marklew</h3>

  <p>Team : McDonnell, Brown, Cooper, Wood, Lloyd, Gardiner, Birch, E Wright, Crisp, Smith, D Wright. Subs: Thomas, Owen (not sure who the other one was)</p>
  <p>Well how depressing. It was just like being at Welling to watch Dartford's last game (only Adam Patrick didn't score the winner in the 53rd minute!)</p>
  <p>We had a few chances at the end, especially when Crispie hit the bar, but really we didn't create much and Grantham scored the only real chance they had early in the second half. I guess you can't expect much considering Evran started (and finished) the game upfront on his own.</p>
  <p>Rumour mongers were out in Grantham though, and suggestions are we may well sign a bloke called Andy Jones from Halesowen Harriers (proven goalscorer, hmmmm!!) and Payne may still come if Kiddie pay out some or all of his remaining contract.</p>
  <p>So I guess it was worth going if only for these rumours (even if they do have a habit of being wrong!)</p>

  <p>That's 4 games on the trot without letting any in now, and subsequently we've climbed to&#xD;

		First-half goals from  <b>Matt Gardiner</b>  and  <b>Evran Wright</b>  set us well on our way,&#xD;

<h3>Match Report from Andi</h3>

  <p>A great game in the cold cold Halesowen air. Man of the Match was Clinton &#xD;
Thomas (could it be anyone else?) as he helped set up Evran (2) and Matty &#xD;
Gardner. A surprising absentee from the game was Richard Crisp, so Ashley &#xD;
Brown was recalled at right back.</p>
  <p>Somehow their number 4 didn't get sent off after continually fouling Clinton &#xD;
the whole game and was only booked. He also got Clinton booked.</p>
  <p>Adie Cooper cleared what would have been a consolation goal for Clevedon off &#xD;
the line. The result puts the Yeltz and 10th and drops me to 4th. (Fantasy &#xD;
Island)</p>

    <p>
  <p>I suppose a lot of Welshmen like to watch the egg-chasing, but it still seems a bit bizarre kicking off at 12.15.</p>
  <p>It must have been a bit strange for the players too, but the mighty <b>Yeltz extended their unbeaten run</b> with a creditable <b>0-0 draw</b> with high-flying <b>Newport</b> . They've climbed up to second-place, and we've snuck into the top half of the table into <b> 11th place </b> .</p>
  <p>Elsewhere, DML teams had a pretty good day in the FA Cup 1st Round (remember that?!), with Ilkeston recovering from the stuffing we gave them to beat Carlisle 2-1, and Tamworth twice coming from behind to earn a draw against Bury.</p>

  <p>After what feels like ages since we last played, the mighty <b>Yeltz won their second game on the trot</b> with a <b>1-0 victory</b> against struggling <b>Crawley</b> . However, only a late goal from on-loan Stuart Payne gave all three points against a team that had only had two draws so far this season.</p>
  <p>According to the <a href="http://www.thisistheblackcountry.co.uk/bc/stour/sport/halesfc/">Halesowen News website</a> we're looking to extend Mr. Payne's loan period as, what with the long break and his injuries, we haven't had him for many games. Anyway, he's got another chance to score on <b>Tuesday</b> when we meet <b>Ilkeston at The Grove</b> in the league.</p>
  <p>We've now snuck up to 13th place in the league now and to be honest we're not that far off the top and the bottom.</p>

    <h3>FAT  Bromsgrove 2 Yeltz 5</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A <b>first Trophy victory for 4 years</b> and a little gloom has been lifted. An emphatic <b>5-2 victory</b> over struggling <b>Bromsgrove</b> and at least we have something positive to look forward to for the rest of the season. Scorers were <b>Crispy</b> , <b>Clinton Thomas (2)</b> , one from <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b> and an <b>own goal</b> .</p>
  <p>We're not playing for a couple of weeks, so maybe it'll give us chance to recharge our batteries, sort out a few injuries and start climbing back up the table.</p>
  <p>LATE NEWS: We've been drawn <b>at home to Sutton Coldfield</b> in the next round of the <b>FA Trophy</b> - the match will take place on November 27. Not a bad draw at all.</p>

    <h3>Dorchester 2 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After the last few results and given a <b>half-time</b> score of <b>2-0 down</b> , spirits were about as low as they've ever been. However, something remarkable happened. Second half goals from <b>Darren Wright</b> and on-loan <b>Stuart Payne</b> meant we came away from Dorchester's super-stadium with an encouraging point.</p>
  <p>We're still struggling in the table having played more games than everyone else now, but they way things have been going I'm sure we'd all have settled for a point before the game.</p>
  <p> <b>Bath</b> beat Farnborough in their FA Cup game, so our game on the 16th will be <b>postponed</b> . We're on FA Trophy duty at Bromsgrove next week. Fingers crossed.</p>

    <h2><a href="/1999/09/25/VERY%20POOR.html">VERY POOR</a></h2>
    <h3>Yeltz 0 Margate 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>I can't remember if I've ever felt so <b>downbeat about our prospects</b> for the rest of the season. For as long as I've supported the Yeltz (over 17 years now) we've always had a pretty good side with the potential to win things. <b>I have no confidence</b> at all that the next 7 months aren't going to be <b>one long relegation battle</b> .</p>
  <p>I hoped that last week's FA Cup debacle would be the turning point, but unfortunately <b>it's got worse</b> . A spineless <b>3-0 defeat</b> at home to <b>Margate</b> . After the win at Atherstone and creditable draw with Boston, we've slipped back again to our early season form. Come on.</p>
  <p>On a (slightly) brighter note, Catalogue Man <b>Paul Harding</b> has finally signed for <b>Dulwich Hamlet</b> after being on loan there for a while. Good riddance. Also, I believe we've got a match next weekend against <b>Dorchester</b> , rearranaged to take advantage of our free FA Cup weekend.</p>

    <h3>FAC2Q  - Oadby 2 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>I usually try and make an effort to put a positive slant on things, as there's enough people around who'll moan if they get half a chance. However this time I'm really struggling.</p>
  <p>They were rubbish. They're a West. Mids. League standard team if you can remember back to those days, and in the first half we outclassed them, <b>leading 1-0</b> at the break with a nice goal from <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b> .</p>
  <p>However, only one team seemed to remember it was the FA Cup in the second half. <b>They battled and scrapped</b> for everything and once they'd <b>snuck an equaliser</b> , we went completely to pieces.</p>
  <p>Whether it was because Birchy had got injured, but no-one (on our side) seemed to have any idea about what to do, and <b>it wasn't a great surprise when they scored the winner</b> . It was a sort of breakaway goal, but describing it like that gives the impression that we were mounting some kind of pressure at the other end.</p>
  <p>We were <b>desperate for a decent cup run</b> to spark the season into life, and now we're left feeling worse than ever. <b>Very poor</b> .</p>
  <p>If you've got anything to say about all of this, I'm sure there will be much discussion this week on the <b> Yeltz mailing list </b> .</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Boston 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In a very hard fought and often violent encounter, the mighty Yeltz continued their recent improvement with <b>a point against leaders Boston</b> .</p>
  <p>It was almost three points as <b>they only equalised late on</b> with a penalty after Danny McD had brought down one of their forwards when he was right through. <b>We'd earlier took a deserved lead</b> through a <b>Crisp penalty</b> after a blatant and stupid handball.</p>
  <p>We played excellently in the first half with <b>Evran Wright</b> , back for his 12th spell at the club, missing a couple of good chances. As the game went on some <b>fierce challenges</b> from both sides led to some <b>very heated debating</b> , culminating in the ref telling Woody and their centre-forward to sort things out behind The (bike) Shed after school. What larks.</p>
  <p>It's <b>FA Cup time</b> again, with next Saturday's trip to <b>Oadby</b> - it's a suburb of Leicester - in the 2nd Qualifying Round. We could do with a decent run.</p>

    <h3>Atherstone 4 Yeltz 5</h3>

    <p>
  <p>All very strange - a team of defenders, Andy Crannage in goal (oh yes, the 45-year-old local celebrity) but <b>it really was Atherstone 4 Yeltz 5</b> .</p>
  <p>Ross Collins played in centre-midfield and Ralphy Crisp played up front but we doubled the season's meagre goal tally in one game, the scorers being <b>Ashley Brown (2), Crispy (2)</b> and another from <b>Ada Cooper</b> .</p>
  <p>We went behind to an early Atherstone goal, took a 3-1 lead but then conceded another before half-time. We then twice went two ahead, were twice pulled back to a single goal lead and eventually were very pleased to take all 3 points. Hu-bloody-rrah!!</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Cambridge City 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>I'm really struggling to say something positive here and I'm not used to that. <b>Another loss</b> , this time to a poor <b>Cambridge</b> side - I have inside knowledge about them and they ARE poor - and we're hovering dangerously near the bottom with little promise of things turning around.</p>
  <p>We actually <b>took the lead</b> early on through <b>Ada Cooper's 2nd of the season</b> - he's equal top scorer now - but they equalised before the break and got a winner 15 mins. before the end. <b>The crowd</b> was once again right down to the <b>real hardcore fans</b> - only 433 this time.</p>
  <p>We've now travel to <b>Atherstone on Monday</b> , where we've done pretty well over the last few seasons. <b>COME ON</b> .</p>
