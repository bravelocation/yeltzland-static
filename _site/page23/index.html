    <h3>Rothwell 2 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <root>
  <p>Let's be <b>grateful for small mercies</b> . Two more goals and an away point aren't too bad, even if it was at perennial strugglers Rothwell.</p>
  <p>They took the lead just before half-time, but then <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b> turned in an Ashley Brown cross after the break. However, we were soon behind again when a free header made it 2-1 to Rothwell, but in the 72nd minute, after a Darren Wright piledriver from 25 yards hit the bar, <b>Ada Cooper</b> knocked in the rebound. (Thanks to DJ Grove for details)</p>
  <p>For a bit of fun I thought I'd trawl through <a href="/anorak/">Anorak Corner</a> and <b>compare our results last season</b> against the teams we've played so far:</p>
  <p>Not so bad when you look at it like that, and definitely helped by the fact that we <b>lost a  <a href="/news/default.asp?month=10&amp;year=1998#story31101998">horrible game at Rothwell</a>  last year</b> . OK, I'm clutching at straws but if enough of us believe this is a turning point it WILL be.</p>

  <p>Can you believe this? Another <b>0-0 draw</b> and the <b>excitement</b> level at The Grove is at an <b>all time low</b> .</p>
  <p>We've only scored in one game out of five now against bottom-placed and pointless Grantham. Computer predictions now say <b>if it goes on like</b> this by the end of the season we'll have scored 17 goals, have 42 points and be <b>getting crowds of about 200</b> .</p>
  <p>We now travel to Rothwell on Monday evening, followed by a match against Cambridge at The Grove on Saturday.</p>
  <p>BTW if you haven't already seen, we're away to either <b>Willenhall or Oadby</b> in the <b>FA Cup</b> 2nd Qualifying Round on Sept. 18.</p>

  <p>Finally! Three points, <b>a couple of goals</b> including a last minute winner and relief all round. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>A very <b>small crowd</b> (422) saw the Yeltz <b>go behind</b> early on to bottom-placed Grantham and things were looking very grim indeed. However second-half goals from <b>Lyndon Rowlands</b> and substitute <b>Robbie Dennison</b> meant we'd finally broken our duck for the season. We've now climbed to a slighly better <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=24081999">14th place</a> </b> in the table.</p>

  <p>I think it's going to be a long season. <b>Three games, no goals</b> scored and another depressing <b>defeat - 2-0 at</b> previously pointless <b>Salisbury</b> .</p>
  <p>Our excellent goal difference means we've only slipped to <b>an impressive  <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=21081999">18th place</a> </b> in the table. Hurrah!</p>

  <p>Two games gone and the Yeltz faithful are <b>still waiting their first goal</b> . At least we <b>gained a point</b> this time <b>away at</b> last season's 3rd placed <b>Ilkeston</b> so it's not too bad I suppose.</p>

  <p>Anyway, I thought you'd like a picture of us <b>actually having a shot</b> on Saturday (courtesy of DJ Yeltz), but I didn't want too make it too big in case you got too excited.</p>

  <p>After a long list of outgoing transfers, it nice to be able to report we've started the process of rebuilding for next season.</p>

  <p>Next is <b>Darren Wright</b> , who's played for loads of teams including Cheltenham when they got promoted a couple of seasons ago. He's a <b>midfielder</b> .</p>
  <p>Rumour has it Mr Chambers is due to make more signings soon - news here as soon as I hear anything.</p>
  <p>On a sad note, <b>Evran has finally been jailed</b> for supplying cannabis, but his sentence is only 9 months which leaves open the possibility we might still see old Supermop back playing down The Grove.</p>

    <h3>Atherstone 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>An eventful and somewhat disappointing season was wrapped up with a <b>2-0 victory</b> at the <b>Atherstone dump</b> .</p>
  <p>Second half goals from <b>Rob Elmes</b> and from <b>Steve Pie-arce (confirmed as the league's top scorer)</b> means we finished in <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=01051999">8th place</a> </b> in the end - not brilliant but a lot better than it could have been when at one point we were in real relegation trouble.</p>
  <p>As usual, the last away game saw the Yeltz fans dressing up in all sorts of stupid costumes. The Jolly Boys hired limos for the day, and the highlight of the day was seeing the <b>Stourbridge bus</b> on the way home which resulted in ... well, I better not say ;-)</p>
  <p>So we enter the dark days of summer with the <b>prospects for next season looking very unclear</b> . It seems certain that Steve Piearce and Ian Reed will be leaving The Grove, and the club's financial situation means we're not really sure how we're going to replace them. I'll bring you any news I hear, so let me know if you hear any gossip, rumours etc.</p>

  <p>The last home game of the season brought another goal-feast to The Grove, a <b>3-3 draw with Hastings</b> featuring yet another <b>Steve Piearce hat-trick</b> (the 4th in 2 months). He's now got an unbelievable <b>30 goals</b> (we've decided to give him the one on Boxing Day) this season despite the fact he was injured for long spells throughout. <b>Please stay Stevo</b> .</p>
  <p>We took the lead just before half-time, but were soon down 2-1 after the break. They replied to Stevo's 2nd almost straight afterwards, and it took an <b>injury-time equaliser</b> for us to gain a point.</p>
  <p>If you didn't know already, the theme for the <b>fancy dress</b> next week at Atherstone is <b>pop-stars</b> - mainly because the Jolly Boys (who've always been known for their great style and taste) have hired <b>several limos</b> for the day.</p>
  <p>It should be a brilliant day, with the added bonus of an extremely <b>exciting conclusion to the  <a href="/haveyoursay/fantasyisland/">Fantasy Island</a>  competition.</b> </p>

    <root>
  <p>The Mighty Yeltz extended their unbeaten run to <b>10 games</b> with a scrappy victory over doomed (hopefully) Cambridge.</p>
  <p>As the Jolly Boys were <b>sponsoring the game</b> (in honour of it being Sean's last game before moving to Barcelona) we were watching from the <b>seats</b> . This was a <b>frightening</b> experience as:</p>
  <p>This meant we had an excellent view of Lloydy barging the <b>Cambridge</b> forward over to concede a penalty which meant they <b>took an early lead</b> . We didn't really do much after that but finally equalised when somehow <b>Matt Gardiner</b> found himself in front of goal to knock in a rebound from the keeper.</p>
  <p>The second half was pretty dire; they were happy to launch any possesion as long as possible, and we simply did nothing. However, we clinched another three points when <b>Ralphy Crisp</b> hit a scorcher into the top corner - although the best bit was his delayed celebrations when he <b>didn't know he'd scored</b> .</p>
  <p>Thanks to the club for everything yesterday, and once again good luck to Sean in his new life in Spain.</p>
