    <h3>Yeltz 3 Salisbury 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A day later and I'm still confused whether to be pleased or not. To come back from 3 behind with only 20 minutes to go is brilliant, but let's not kid ourselves - it was a relegation battle that we needed to win.</p>
  <p>
    After a couple of clean sheets we hoped the defensive problems had been sorted out, but we gifted themall three goals with sloppy marking. They must have been feeling sorry for us as they leftcompletely open for our first, and thenscored a beauty.

  <p>Another clean sheet and another point, but this time it was a very creditable 0-0 draw away to second placed Bath. They'd only let in one goal in the last 7 games, and had won their last 5 home games, so this was an excellent result.</p>
