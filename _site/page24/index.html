    <h3>Yeltz 2 Bath 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Another game, <b>another 2-2 draw</b> and another point nearer safety. It all sounds a bit <b>boring</b> , but watching the mighty Yeltz is <b>anything but that</b> at the moment, with brilliant attacking being cancelled out by some less than brilliant defending.</p>
  <p>We started off like the proverbial train, so it was inevitable when they took the lead <b>completely against the run of play</b> through the superbly-named <b>Fidell</b> Richards. Thankfully we finally equalised just before the break when <b>super-striker Rob Elmes</b> was left unmarked to nod in a Neil Smith cross.</p>
  <p>The second-half was more of the same; we piled forward, hitting the post, blazing it over, some mad scrambles, <b>going behind again</b> and then getting a <b>late equaliser</b> when <b>Stevo smashed in a shot</b> from the edge of the box into the roof of the net.</p>
  <p>I'm off on me hols for a few days over Easter, so the site may be a bit out of date (no news there then), but I'll <b>do what I can</b> .</p>

    <p>
  <p>The Mighty Yeltz continue their gradual climb to safety with <b>another draw</b> , this time against high-flying Ilkeston.</p>
  <p>We were twice in the lead, first after a goal from <b>Wayne Lloyd</b> . Then after they'd equalised just before half-time, we went ahead again after another from the unstoppable goal machine <b>Rob Elmes</b> . However, they got a late equaliser which means we're now in <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=20031999">10th place</a> </b> , 9 pts above the relegation zone.</p>
  <p>We've got <b>Bath next Saturday</b> , and don't forget it's a <b>1pm kick-off</b> because of the England game.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Weymouth 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Despite bravely fighting back from two goals down, it's now <b>impossible</b> for The Mighty Yeltz <b>to go up this year</b> .</p>
  <p>It was a reasonable game all in all. We gave them a <b>two goal start</b> with some <b>awful defending</b> , the second in particular a terrible mix-up between Forrest Gump and Danny.</p>
  <p>I must admit we we're on the way to the clubhouse for our usual half-time ablutions when <b>Rob Elmes finally scored his first</b> , but from all accounts he didn't know much about it when the keeper tried to clear the ball only to fire it straight against Elmesey. Still <b>he's deserved one</b> (at least) for his efforts in the last few games.</p>
  <p>We had much of the play in the second-half as we pushed for an equaliser, but it took and excellent move and a quality finish from <b>Ada Cooper</b> to get the point a few minutes before the end.</p>
  <p>Other news: Evran's court case has been adjourned again, and <a href="/stuff/catalogue.asp">Catalogue Man</a> scored for Harrow Borough.</p>

    <p>
  <p>The <b>promotion race continues</b> as another <b>Yeltz victory</b> means we can still catch leaders Nuneaton - with 10 games to go <b>we're only 29 points behind</b> them in <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=06031999">a remarkable  <b>8th place</b> </a> .</p>
  <p>It's actually quite nice to even bother to <b>look up the table</b> , but a fourth consecutive victory has hopefully easied our relegation worries a little.</p>
  <p>After a goalless first half, we took the lead with a goal from (who else) <b>Steve Pie-arce</b> , and then added a second from <b>Reedy</b> . Dorchester pulled one back soon after, but then <b>Stevo</b> got his <b>9th in four games</b> and we'd won again.</p>

    <p>
  <p>I'm not sure I can cope with this! <b>A third successive win</b> , 10 goals in all with an incredible 7 from <b>Stevo Piearce</b> .</p>
  <p>Things didn't look too good when Worcester took an early lead, and were two up by half-time. <b>Pie-arce</b> pulled one back soon after, but then we went 3-1 down when they scored again and were just about out of it. Unbelievably, <b>Paul Birch</b> got it back to 2-3, then <b>Stevo</b> got the <b>equaliser</b> and then a late <b>winner</b> and we'd won again. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Even more good news was the report in the <a href="http://www.newsquestmidlands.co.uk/newsgrp/stour/sport/htfc">Halesowen News</a> that <b>Harrow</b> are interested in taking <b>Paul Harding on loan</b> for a bit. Could things get any better?</p>
  <p>With several teams below us also winning it's crucial we keep this winning run going next week against Dorchester.</p>

    <h3>Salisbury 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In one of the tensest games for many a while, <b>The Mighty Yeltz</b> battled to a brilliant victory against a Salisbury team that had previously gone 12 games unbeaten.</p>
  <p>Out in the Wiltshire countryside, a <b>strong wind</b> was blowing straight down the pitch and we took full advantage playing with it in the first half. Steve <b>Piearce</b> scored the first when he poked out a foot and looped the ball over the keeper at the end of a fine move.</p>
  <p>We then went further ahead when young <b>Birch</b> scuttled after a long ball down the left, put over a briiliant cross to <b>Elmes</b> , who headed it past the keeper for his first ever goal - although <b>Pie-arce</b> followed in to make sure to <b>technically claim the goal</b> .</p>
  <p>When we turned around for the <b>second half</b> , we knew we were in for a battle when <b>they scored early on</b> , and it was unbearably exciting as Salisbury chased the equaliser, and we tried to hit them on the break. Rob <b>Elmes ran himself to a standstill</b> - although only one person in the whole ground knows <b>why he wasn't substituted earlier</b> - and Piearce and Birchy played particularly well.</p>
  <p>Then they put a header over the bar from a what looked like a yard out, I'd won the sweep and my <b>lucky socks</b> had done the business again. Hurrah!</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 4 Rothwell 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>This was a <b>CRUCIAL</b> win in our relegation battle. A loss would have dropped us into the relegation zone, but two goals from young <b>Birch</b> and another two from <b>Pie-arce</b> has moved us up a couple of places in the <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=13021999">table</a> to a whopping 16th.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already heard, <b>Delton Francis</b> has been sold to Conference side <b>Kingstonian</b> for a fee of either £10,000 or £18,000 depending on who you listen to. The longstanding rumours of <b>Evran's problems</b> with the law have been proved true - he's <b>in court on March 8th</b> on drugs-related charges - so I've no idea who's going to playing up front soon.</p>
  <p>On a "brighter" note, the Halesowen News says <b>Hastings will be resigning from the Premier League</b> next season as their Mr Moneybags has pulled out, which should mean <b>one less team will be relegated</b> . Hopefully we won't be depending on this at the end of the season</p>

    <p>
  <p>I've had enough now. It's desperation time after another loss in the League, so it's time to get out your <b>lucky pants</b> , good-luck charms, whatever... the line HAS been drawn - <b>this is where the fight back begins</b> .</p>
  <p>This is not the time to start blaming anyone. OK since <b>John Chambers</b> has come in we've only <b>won twice</b> in the league, and one of those was against <b>hapless Bromsgrove</b> . The other, as we all remember, was against runaway leaders <b>Nuneaton</b> so we know we CAN do it.</p>
  <p>The only part we can play is to try and get behind the team as much as possible. I know everyone is bewildered and a little upset about how things are going, but there'll be plenty of time for recrimination in the summer if we do go down.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Gloucester 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A rusty-looking Yeltz dropped to only <b> <a href="/anorak/table.asp?date=30011999">one place above the relegation zone</a> </b> with a very depressing 1-0 loss at home to Glouceter.</p>
  <p>You might have thought the long break would have left us <b>raring to go</b> , but on a very cut up pitch - what price having other teams pay us to ruin the pitch if we go down? - <b>we struggled to get anything going</b> .</p>
  <p>They had one very successful tactic; give it to their <b>big center-forward</b> and let him run at our defence. &#xD;
The only plan we had was to <b>hack him down</b> , but unfortunately (and pretty obviously) all this led to was 3 bookings and a <b>penalty</b> .</p>
  <p>We tried hard in the second half, and did manage to hit the bar (with the ball, not at half-time). However even with <b>Pie-arce</b> coming on (not looking fully recovered) and nearly sneaking one, we never really threatened their keeper. <b>Very disappointing</b> .</p>

  <p>The Yeltz earned a hard-fought point on Saturday with <b>an excellent 1-1 draw at high-flying Crawley</b> .</p>
  <p>They're probably the only team who can get remotely close to Nuneaton if they win their games in hand, so it was never going to be easy. <b>They had most of the play</b> , but the defence - and Danny in particular - were well solid. We even <b>took the lead</b> through a <b>Ralphy Crisp</b> header just after half-time, but they equalised just after and piled on the pressure. However we held firm and <b>came away with a welcome point</b> .</p>

  <p>It was <b>our first visit to Grantham's new(ish) out-of-town stadium, a horrible affair</b> with a running track and a couple of character-less concrete stands on each side. <b>A strong wind</b> blowing straight down the boggy pitch <b>hindered</b> any attempts at playing good football, and to be honest <b>not a lot happened</b> . They were a big team without much skill, and we battled hard without really threatening.</p>
  <p>At the end of <b>a productive holiday period</b> (I think we'd have been happy with 7 points beforehand, although probably would have expected to gain them in a different manner), <b>we've climbed up to 12th place in the table</b> , although this could have changed after this afternoon's (Sunday's) games.</p>
  <p>It's very close except at the very top and the very bottom. <b>The good news</b> is we're only 7 points behind 2nd-placed Boston - <b>the bad news</b> is we're only 5 points above the relegation zone and every one below us has got games in hand.</p>

    After a couple of clean sheets we hoped the defensive problems had been sorted out, but we gifted themall three goals with sloppy marking. They must have been feeling sorry for us as they left <b>Pie-arce</b> completely open for our first, and then <b>The Prodigal One</b> scored a beauty.
    
  </p>
  <p>We didn't realise they'd kicked off the second half early (not that we usually get out the clubhouse in time) and didn't realise that when we got a late penalty - a trip on Evran - it was going to be the last kick. <b>Crispy</b> kept his nerve fantastically well and just knocked it in the top corner.
