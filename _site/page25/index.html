    <h3>DMC  Bromsgrove 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The Yeltz safely progressed through to the next round of the League Cup by beating Bromsgrove 2-1, 3-1 on aggregate.</p>
  <p>
    The game was delayed for a long time just after the kick-off when one of the Bromsgrove defenders unfortunately broke his leg. When the game was finally restarted, we flew at Bromsgrove and early goals fromandmeant the tie was just about safe. We perhaps should have scored more, but despite a late consolation for Bromsgrove we ran out easy winners.

    <p>The first point under John Chambers was gained in a 0-0 draw against local rivals Worcester at The Grove. I guess we should celebrate a second clean sheet in a row, but three points would have been nice the way we're gradually slipping down the table.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Where 7 minutes of injury-time came from I'll never know, but it was a very promising performance under new manager John Chambers.</p>
  <p>
    Such a lot happened in the game I haven't really got space to give the match justice. They took the lead early on from an easy header, and our pre-match half-joking predictions of 0-4 being a good result weren't looking so funny any more. Then  into the top corner and we were back in it.

    <h3>Dorchester 2 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After the false dawn of a couple of wins, The Yeltz are back to their depressing ways, this time losing 2-0 at bottom of the table Dorchester.</p>
  <p>Dorchester had only previously won one game against Grantham, so this was particularly disappointing. I think the manager situation needs sorting out quickly, as the way things are going we could well be in relegation trouble before long.</p>
  <p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Merthyr 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    Colin Brookes says he doesn't want to be the new manager, but his spell as caretaker manager has started excellently. Two wins on the trot and . Unbelievable!
    
  </p>
  <p>The latest victory was against last year's runners-up Merthyr. The Yeltz took advantage of the strong wind in the second half to score two excellent goals. Delton scored the first from a crisp Crisp cross, and Piearce clinched an excellent result with a controversial second, on the break after Merthyr were denied a penalty, poor things. :-)</p>

    <h3>DMC  Yeltz 1 Bromsgrove 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Yeltz fans were greeted with the disappointing news that manager Stewart Hall has "resigned by mutual consent". After such a poor start to the season it wasn't completely unexpected as it was clear that something had to be done.</p>
  <p>Stewart's record in his four years in charge was excellent, taking us to our highest position ever in the non-league pyramid. Personally I found him a great bloke, always willing to chat about the game and interested in what you had to say.</p>
  <p>
    Colin Brookes is temporarily in charge, and his appointment brought an immediate upturn in fortunes with  A late goal from Paul Birch, a top corner screamer, finally broke the run of six defeats. Phew!

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Kings Lynn 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>And it gets worse. Another very disappointing loss, this time 0-1 at home to lowly King's Lynn and we're in big trouble. We've now lost 6 on the trot and are just two points above the relegation zone, with most of the teams below us having games in hand.</p>
  <p>It's now pretty obvious that something is seriously wrong. Rumours of emergency board meetings must mean Stewart Hall's job is in jeopardy now. Personally I've always thought he's a brilliant manager, but I'm not sure how long the current slide can be allowed to continue without something being done.</p>
  <p>
    I'm sure we'll be discussing this on the  this week, so if you've got anything to say on this (or any) subject, please feel free to join in.

    <h3>Boston 2 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Despite having close to a full strength side out, The Yeltz couldn't break out of their losing streak, going down 2-0 in a freezing Boston.</p>
  <p>We actually played pretty well without having any luck at all. We had the better of a quiet first half without really threatening. Then just after half time, one of their players collapsed in the box after what looked like an innocuous challenge and we were one down.</p>
  <p>From then on we were all over them, with their keeper making a fantastic save from Birch (my man of the match) and tipping a Del-boy 30-yard lob onto the bar. Then they scored a second completely against the run of play with a spectacular long-range shot, and the ridiculous Harding - for the love of God, just go - got sent off for dissent.</p>
  <p>Even down to ten men - or perhaps because of - we still outplayed Boston but couldn't even get a consolation. Stewart looked very miserable walking off, and there were rumours of emergency board meetings being held this week. Hmmm.</p>

    <h3>Rothwell 2 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Four losses on the trot - things aren't looking too good at the moment.</p>
  <p>On an atrocious day, new signing Delton Francis fired The Yeltz into an early lead at Rothwell on Saturday. Our increasingly shaky defence managed to hold out until the 75th minute, but then an equaliser and a late Rothwell winner meant we went home pointless (again).</p>

    <h3>FAT  Yeltz 0 Guiseley 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Yet another disappointing Cup defeat - this time losing 2-0 at home to Guiseley in the FA Trophy. Goals halfway through each half clinched it for the visitors, but without Pie-arce up front (again) we hardly managed a shot.</p>
  <p>The good news is Delton Francis has signed from Hednesford for supposedly a five-figure fee and will be available for next weekend. Delton's done brilliant in his loan spell at The Grove, and should make an excellent partner for Pie-arce.</p>
  <p>
    We're finally back in league action on Saturday when we visit Rothwell. There's been some confusion about whether Rothwell are still in the FA Cup - the papers and Ceefax say they are, but the club assure us they aren't - so as far as we know, the matchon. For up-to-date information, your best bet is joining the.

    <h3>FAC  Yeltz 1 Gresley 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Well I suppose it was exciting but we're out of the FA Cup for another year, losing 2-1 to Gresley at The Grove.</p>
  <p>
    The weather played a big part in the game, and we got to half-time 0-0 playing more or less into the gale. Thenscored with an over-the-shoulder volley after their pony-tailed goalie had fumbled a cross. We were all over them for a while, with Matt Gardiner coming close from 40 yards (it was windy) and Rob Elmes hitting the bar with what would have been goal of the century.
    
  </p>
  <p>The trouble was Gresley are a good team and eventually they equalised and then took the lead in the 87th minute from a couple of corners. Even then we had chances to equalise as the ref played an age of injury time but it wasn't to be.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Another excellent result - a 5-1 stuffing of newly promoted Grantham at The Grove.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz took the lead in the first half with a couple of goals from Reedy and Lord Bradley. They then pulled one back which left it 2-1 at half-time. Delton Francis, in what could be his last performance as his loan period is now finished, then scored two more and Simon Black got one late on. Excellent!</p>

  All you unbelievers out there - it's time to worship at the. A 50 yard thunderbolt (it gets longer the more people who tell me about it) clinched a 1-0 victory in the FA Cup replay at Eastwood. We're now at home to Gresley next Saturday in the 3rd Qualifying Round

    <p>
  <p>We making hard work of it, but we're still in the FA Cup. Despite twice being ahead, it ended up 2-2 with the replay on Wednesday.</p>
  <p>Nothing happened in the first half, and not a lot in the second until their semi-retired keeper decided to drop the ball at Matty Gardiner's feet in front of goal. Our defence then went walkabout (again) to let them back in it, but it looked as though we'd clinched it when the best move of the game led to a Yeltz second.</p>
  <p>Super-winger Rob Elmes broke down the right, and his first time cross picked out Pie-arce for a superb winner in the 88th minute. Unfortunately, Eastwood then went down the other end and got another equaliser, a sort of swivelly over the shoulder shot that snuck in the corner.</p>
  <p>The replay's on Wednesday, and the winner will be at home to Gresley in the next round.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Despite their ridiculously long injury list getting even longer, The Yeltz continued to improve with a 3-1 victory at home to Atherstone.</p>
  <p>It was 0-0 at half time, but a penalty converted by Crispy after a handball put Halesowen into the lead. Delton Francis scored from an acute angle soon afterwards, and Mark Peters scored a third near the end, with Atherstone scoring from the spot in injury time.</p>

    <h3>Cambridge 2 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After all, what is there to be depressed about? We have got one point in the last four games. Clean sheets count for nothing, so who cares that we haven't had one this season?</p>
  <p>The game at Cambridge followed the usual trend of us looking reasonable without actually creating anything and then letting in a couple of pretty average goals with some pretty average defending. To be fair, the injury crisis meant that Rob Elmes had to play up front for what I can only assume was for the first time ever, and their keeper did make one good save.</p>
