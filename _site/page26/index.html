    <h3>Yeltz 3 Gresley 4</h3>

    <p>And it gets worse... this time a 3-4 loss to former champions Gresley, who now done the double over us this season. Yeltz scorers were Birch, Peters and Reed. Hmmm.</p>

    <p>With the mighty Yeltz decimated by injury, unsurprisingly we lost again, this time 2-0 away at Hastings. Of course an alternative explanation is that we're not very good at the moment, but obviously that couldn't be true.</p>

  <p>Another disappointing result. I suppose the new players need a bit off time to gel together, but it's not been the most promising of starts.</p>
  <p>It all started so well, with Danny saving a penalty and then Pie-arce scoring to put us ahead. Burton scrambled in an equaliser before the break, then scored two more in the second half for a deserved victory.</p>

    <h3>Kings Lynn 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After failing in the mountains of Gresley, The Yeltz got an improved result - if not performance - back at sea level in the flatlands of King's Lynn.</p>
  <p>
    They'd lost their first two games and to be honest were terrible. We gifted them a goal early on when Woody was caught dawd-lynnon the ball by their giant centre-forward, who then couldn't miss. We dominated from then on without really looking convincing. There was a couple of scrambles and Pie-arce hit the bar with a header before we finally equalised late on.
    
  </p>
  <p>A brilliant free-kick from young Birch could only be pushed out by the Lynn keeper into the path of Ian Reed, who smacked it in with relish. I'll maybe write a full report later, but as usual don't hold your breath :-)</p>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz came unstuck in the backstreets of Gresley, losing 2-0 to the champions of two seasons ago.</p>
  <p>We always seem to struggle here - the only reason I can think of is their bizarrely sloping pitch. I think it's terrible any team should be allowed to play on a ground that isn't perfectly flat - like wot ours is (now). :-)</p>

    <p>A winning start! Despite going behind to an early goal, The Yeltz came back to beat Crawley 3-2 with the winner coming from new (but old) bloke Paul Birch late on. The other goals were scored by the injury hit front line of Pie-arce and Harding. Hurrah!</p>

    <h3></h3>

    <root>
  <H3>TRANSFERS</H3>
  <p>I guess we hadn't thought through the effects of the Bosman ruling. The summer started with the shock departure of <b>Snapper</b> to Hereford. He wanted Conference football, we couldn't give it to him so he left. I think it was difficult for him, and it sure was for us.</p>
  <p> <b>Stuart Evans</b> also left for Hereford, <b>Jason Owen</b> 's gone to Stafford, and <b>Evran</b> gone for his summer holidays to Worcester - we're expecting him back any day now. <b>Kevin Harrison</b> 's arthritic knee has meant he's had to call it a day, and <b>Sharpey</b> has been released.</p>
  <p>Luckily, Stewart has been busy getting in some replacements. <b>Tim Langford</b> is back from Telford, and <b>Neil Smith</b> , ex-Rushden but actually from Halesowen has also signed. Two more from Bromsgrove have arrived - <b>Mark Peters</b> , a midfielder and <b>Rob Elmes</b> , a defender. Finally, we've signed <b>Simon Black</b> , a forward who used to play with Pie-arce at Doncaster before he got glandular fever.</p>
  <p>We started with our traditional opener against the Albion. After we beat them a few years ago, they usually put a decent team out now, and we lost 4-0. Next was a 2-1 win at Oldbury, then 0-0 draws in Andy Bradley's testimonial against old rivals Hednesford and against Sandwell Borough. An excellent 1-0 stuffing of Stourbridge, a 3-1 win over Stourport and a 2-0 loss against Blakenall completed the warm-up.</p>

    <h3>Hastings 2 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    And it's all over again. A 2-2 draw at Hastings, but with <b>the anointed one</b> gettting a late equaliser - it doesn't get much better than that
    
  </p>
  <p>I guess it was a 7 out of 10 sort of season. We finished 5th in the end, but except for a short time around January, we never really looked like challenging. We did <b>win the B'ham Senior Cup</b> though. Talking to Stewart after the game, we can expect a few new faces next season, and the release of some of the current squad. Roll on August.</p>
  <p> <b>Forest Green</b> clinched the title by beating Bath 2-0 and so move up to the Conference. St. Leonards, Ashford and Sittingbourne will be replaced by Grantham, Ilkeston and Weymouth, but it looks like Bromsgrove may be saved as Chelmsford's facilities aren't up to standard.</p>

    <p>An Evran goal in the last minute clinched a 2-1 win against Bath. They had taken the lead, but Evran also got the equaliser. We're now 6th, but could finish anywhere from 3rd to 7th. Exciting or what.</p>

    <h3>BSC FINAL  Yeltz 3 Redditch 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Despite having a few doubts about whether it really matters, The Yeltz won their first trophy in <b>9 years</b> by beating a weary Redditch 3-1 in the B'ham Senior Cup Final.</p>
  <p>We took an early lead through a Snapper long-distance strike, but then Redditch equalised and generally looked the more dangerous. It was their fifth game in five days, so the longer it went, the more you felt they must tire.</p>
  <p>Sharpey poked home a second after the break, but only a couple of brilliant saves by Danny and some mad scrambles kept us ahead. Finally, Kevin scored the third after a brilliant move on the break, and the trophy was ours. We celebrated in the traditional manner, taking turns putting the lid on our head whilst drinking too much in the clubhouse.</p>
  <p>In the league, Forest Green beat Merthyr 3-1, and now only need a draw at home to Bath to go up. If they lose, Merthyr will win the title if they can go to Ashford and win. At the bottom, it's two out of Salisbury, Sittingbourne and Bromsgrove to join St. Leonards and Ashford in the bottom four.</p>
  <p>
    We've got Bath at home in the league on Thursday, then it's fancy dress for the last game at Hastings ().
    
  </p>
  <p>PS The Jolly Boys drew 2-2 in their game vs. Radio WM on Sunday, a match that was much better than the Crawley game the day before according to some observers!</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Crawley 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A disappointing 1-0 loss against Crawley, but I guess there's really nothing to play for. Not a lot to be said really.</p>
  <p>It's a big week coming up with the last three games of the season - our first final in many years on Tuesday in the B'ham Senior Cup against Redditch, then the last two league games, at home to Bath on Thursday and then down to Hastings on Saturday - usual fancy dress applies.</p>
  <p>There's also the huge charity game - Halesowen Jolly Boys supporters vs. Radio WM All-Stars (or something like that) at The Grove tomorrow (Sunday). Unfortunately your editor can't make the game, but he's already scored on the hallowed turf last time we played there so he's not too bothered :-)</p>
  <p>The latest on the talk of creating a Conference Division Two - Friday's Times said the Conference are going ahead with their application to the FA to create the new division. There should be a decision made by June 6, and if successful it will be in place for the 1999-2000 season.</p>

    <h3>Forest Green 2 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>A tactical 2-0 loss to Forest Green to try and keep good friends Merthyr in the league. It might well work as they crashed 3-0 at Burton and are now back in second. Elsewhere, Bromsgrove beat Sittingbourne to boost their chances of staying up.</p>
  <p>There's also renewed talk of creating a Conference Division Two - the Telegraph reports of a meeting this week between the FA and Conference officials - but I guess this won't be appearing (if at all) until the season after next. I reckon we might go up if we have to finish in the top seven!</p>

    <h3>Worcester 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The statisticians have spoken - there's now no possible way we can go up, even with the most unlikely combination of results and some jobs-worth ground graders. A 1-1 draw against Worcester (scorer E. Wright) has left us in 6th place with the best we can now do is 3rd.</p>
  <p>In the big game, Merthyr stuffed Forest Green 4-0 to go a point above them. We now go down to the woods on Saturday in a game that's a lot more important for them than for us.</p>

  <p>I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere about Bath and rain, but I suggest you make one up yourself as it's bound to be funnier than the one I thought of. Rain, snow and all sorts meant there was no chance of playing.</p>
  <p>In other games, Forest Green are now two points clear of Merthyr which sets up their clash on Monday nicely, and Ashford are now relegated.</p>

    <p>
  <p>It's been a long run, but we've finally made it. Goals from Evran, Sharpy and Cooper clinched a 3-2 victory after extra-time against Blues in the B'ham Senior Cup semi-final. We've now got Redditch - who we beat earlier in the season in the FA Cup - in the final, which I think will be held at The Hawthorns. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>We've also now scored 100 goals in all competitions this season (55 games so far), which is not bad at all.</p>

    <h3>Sittingbourne 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>On an extremely blustery day at Sittingbourne's oversized and ridiculously named Central Park, Yeltz keeper Danny McDonnell made two - yes two - penalty saves to earn Halesowen a point in a 0-0 draw.</p>
  <p>It was a pretty nondescript game really, with the wind making it very difficult to play. Stewart managed to get sent off for disputing the penalty decisions - he had a point from our vantage point of 150 yards away - and we had a couple of shots without hitting the target.</p>
  <p>It's all square at the top between Merthyr and Forest Green. Both teams' grounds have been passed for promotion, but Merthyr have initially been refused as they were notionally reformed in the summer after financial problems. They're hoping to appeal, and let's hope that whoever tops the table is the team to go up.</p>
  <p>In the morning, the Jolly Boys supporter's team inflicted the first ever defeat on Sittingbourne supporters with an exciting 4-3 victory. Once again thanks to Sittingbourne for their excellent hospitality, and maybe we'll be able to play them again next season if they can stay up.</p>

  <p>After the tedium of the game at Cambridge, at least there were a couple of goals. Their star player Neil Harris has left to exotic Millwall but we still couldn't beat them - our goal coming from Evran.</p>
  <p>In other games, Merthyr and Forest Green both won. They've still to meet in the league, so obviously those two games are going to be crucial. At the bottom, St. Leonards' brief stay in the Premier is over already, with Ashford almost down as well.</p>
