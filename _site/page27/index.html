    <h3>Yeltz 3 Bromsgrove 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Another victory (3-1) against a team who look like they're going down. Goals from Evran, Crispy and Evans means that Bromsgrove are stuck in the bottom four, whereas we're back up to 3rd place.</p>
  <p>
    After a few decent seasons in the Conference, Bromsgrove are now looking like doing a Stafford Rangers and dropping straight through. It makes you wonder whether it's worth going up.
    
  </p>
  <p>At the top, it's all pretty close again with Merthyr only drawing at Rothwell and Forest Green winning at Hastings.</p>

    <h3>St Leonards 2 Yeltz 5</h3>

    <p>I'll leave it all to Dave Johnson and his excellent fish-based match report. All I'll say is I know St. Leonards are bottom of the league, but it's nice to score five anyway.</p>

    <h3>WSC  Kidderminster 1 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    Hopes were high after we stuffed them last year, but despite probably deserving more we once again lost to Kiddy 1-0 in the insignificantWorcester Senior Cup.
    
  </p>
  <p>We missed quite a few chances, and ex-Yeltzman Darren Steadman should have been sent off when handballing outside the area to stop Steve Pie-arce, but that's two games without scoring now, and we haven't won in four.</p>

    <h3>Cambridge 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>At one point in the second half we put 6 passes together. That was about the most memorable thing in a pretty 0-0 draw at Cambridge.</p>
  <p>I suppose they weren't that bad really, and young McDonnell made a couple of brilliant saves to keep us in it. Stewart told me that supposedly there were scouts from Ajax watching City's wonderboy Neil Harris, who's already had trials with Liverpool and Cologne, but he felt sure that Danny would have impressed them.</p>

    <h3>BSC  Yeltz 1 Paget 1</h3>

    <p>What a wheeze! The Yeltz cleverly decided to let Paget get a 1-1 draw in the B'ham Senior Cup knowing that, because their neighbours are afraid of their floodlights, they'll have to return to The Grove for a money-spinning replay. Halesowen's scorer was Evran, and the crowd was a mighty 302.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Tamworth 1</h3>

    <p>We reckoned we'd probably need to win every game to stand a chance. We only drew at home to Tamworth 1-1, so I think we can OFFICIALLY announce the end of our promotion hopes. After the promise of the last few games, it's a bit depressing to go back to playing so poorly. We needed a late penalty from Steve Piearce to earn the point, and didn't really deserve any more.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 Nuneaton 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>I'm going to keep saying it - that's three wins on the trot now, as the Yeltz overpowered Nuneaton 3-0 in another excellent performance. Goals from Cooper, Evans (also named man of the match by the FYI Jolly Boys - we were sponsoring the match) and a penalty by Crispy.</p>
  <p>I'd like to take time to thank the club for their hospitality yesterday; it was a bit strange watching from the Harry Rudge Stand, and I think that's why Evo won MOTM, as for once we could actually see what our defenders do!</p>

    <h3>Bath 1 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>Two on the trot. After stuffing bottom-placed Ashford away on Saturday, our away form continues to improve as we beat Bath 3-1 at Twerton Park. All three goals were scored by Steve Pie-arce before they got a late consolation goal, and the three points have put us back up to 5th place in the table. I reckon if we win our last 12 league games we'll do it :-)</p>

    <h3>Ashford 0 Yeltz 5</h3>

    <p>Finally we show some decent away form. In our first 'pools' match for some time, it was a Valentine's Day massacre as we stuffed bottom-placed Ashford 5-0 with goals from Piearce (2), Evran (2) and Cooper. Hurrah! (sorry that just slipped out).</p>

    <h3>BSC  Tamworth 2 Yeltz 2 (2-3 on pens)</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Our only away win in the league (so far?) came there, and now The Yeltz stormed into the quarter-finals of the B'ham Senior Cup with an exciting win on penalties against Tamworth.</p>
  <p>We twice came from behind to force extra-time with goals from Crisp and Piearce - the latter in injury time - and won 3-2 on penalties with goals from Kevin, Pie-arce and Crisp (Snapper missed his). We're away to Paget in the quarters.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Rothwell 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Well that piece of psychology certainly worked. Stewart Hall's ploy of putting just about the whole squad on the transfer list backfired badly as we lost only our second league game of the season to lowly Rothwell (1-3 - scorer Wright).</p>
  <p>I think that really is it for any chance of promotion as we're left miles behind in 9th place.</p>

    <h3>BSC  Yeltz 2 Tamworth 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Our glorious B'ham Senior Cup run continues with an exciting 2-2 draw against Tamworth.</p>
  <p>We were 1-0 down at half-time and shortly after the break had Snapper sent off, presumably for dissent after a foul. This sparked us into action, and goals from Reed and a Cripsy penalty meant we looked like going through, especially as they were also down to 10 men by now. However deep into injury time, they equalised from a retaken free-kick.</p>

  <p>Well I don't understand it. We're brilliant at The Grove, but keep losing away - this time 0-1 to Salisbury. For those of you who aren't following closely, the depressing stats are as follows:</p>
  <p>We're now miles behind in 9th place, and I'm going to say it's all over in the hope that as I'm always wrong it might make a difference. Desperate, us?</p>

    <p>
  <p>An excellent 2-1 away win (haven't said that much this year) against Bromsgrove, but unfortunately it was only in the Worcestershire Senior Cup. Goals from Cooper and Yates means we're through to the semi-finals already.</p>
  <p>Other results means we've slipped to 7th place in the league now. Ho hum.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Merthyr 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Some excellent finishing and quality football meant the final score was Halesowen 7 Merthyr 1 - unfortunately that was only the supporters' game in the morning. In the real thing, The Yeltz twice came from behind to draw 2-2 in a game we really needed to win.</p>
  <p>
    Two brilliant pieces of finishing by Merthyr's Ian Mitchell, separated by a brilliant move and finish by Piearce meant we went in at the break 2-1 behind.
    
  </p>
  <p>We came out strongly in the second half and Crispy scored a (goalden) wonder of a goal, flicking it up and then volleying it in from all of 60 yards - it gets farther out the more I think about it.</p>
  <p>With just about all of the other chasers winning, we've slipped back to 6th place. We CAN still do it, but we really need to start putting a winning run together.</p>

    <h3>Nuneaton 2 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Our first loss in 11 games in the league - 1-2 away to Nuneaton - partly due to some poor finishing and partly due to a ridiculous ref.</p>
  <p>I guess a draw would have been a fair result. It was an excellent game in which we always looked dangerous going forward. They took the lead halfway through the second-half, and we equalised through an Evran header.</p>
  <p>Then in injury time Woody got sent off for a second booking, although from where I was standing (admittedly 80 yards away) it looked harsh. They then went and nicked a winner and  Stewart had a quiet few words with the ref after the game.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Yeltz 7 Villa 4. Of course this is a serious tournament. Brian Little must be worried for his job after the team that's in the last 8 of the UEFA Cup is been dumped out of the B'ham Senior Cup by the mighty Yeltz.</p>
  <p>Scorers: Piearce 2, Crisp 2 (1 pen), Cooper, Reed and Yates - it was after extra time, but 7 is a pretty good total.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Our brilliant home record continues with an impressive 4-1 victory against fellow promotion hopefuls Kings Lynn.</p>
  <p>
    The Yeltz took the lead just before half-time from Steve Pie-arce, and then took the flatlanders apart after the break with further goals from Reed, Wrightand Piearce again.
    
  </p>
  <p>Merthyr only drew at Bromsgrove, and with other teams playing in the Trophy (fools) we're&#xD;
back up to 3rd place.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Another late goal - this time an Evran volley - gained The Yeltz a well-deserved draw &#xD;
against Bromsgrove.</p>
  <p>We took the lead through Luke Yates early on, but they equalised before half-time.&#xD;
Bromsgrove then took the lead in dubious circumstances, when Carter used his hand to set up the goal. Unfortunately the referee didn't see anything wrong and despite vehement protests from players and fans alike, the goal stood with Paul Harding being sent off for dissent.</p>
  <p>However justice (of sorts) was done when Evran volleyed home a Pie-arce header nine minutes from time. Phew!</p>
