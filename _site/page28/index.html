    <h3>Yeltz 2 Hastings 1</h3>

    <p>Once again we left it late to clinch the points - coming from behind to beat Hastings 2-1&#xD;
with a Steve Piearce goal and an 88th minute poke-in from Ada Cooper at a fog-bound Grove. We had loads of chances, but their keeper made some excellent saves.</p>

    <h3>Rothwell 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <root>
  <p>Another away draw at Rothwell 1-1. We can say we're definitely better at home&#xD;
than away this season! Our league record so far is now:</p>
  <p>We're still in 3rd place. Merthyr finally let a&#xD;
goal in but they beat Crawley 2-1 and are now 9 points above us with a game in hand.</p>

    <p>The Yeltz march up the table (we're now 3rd) continues&#xD;
with a 2-1 win over Dorchester. Evran got the first just after half-time, and we we're looking in command until Dorchester got a shock equalizer in the 87th minute. However Snapper saved the day by poking in the winner in injury time. Phew!</p>

    <p>It's all over. A 2-0 loss at home to Northwich is no disgrace, but it was another disappointing Yeltz performance. We had much of the play but never really looked like scoring, and Northwich fully deserved their victory.</p>
