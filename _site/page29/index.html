    <h3>Yeltz 5 Gresley 0</h3>

    <p>Hurrah! The famine is over as The Yeltz put five past hapless Gresley. Goals from Cooper, Harrison, Piearce, Crisp and Yates move Halesowen up to third and leave reigning champions Gresley one place off the bottom.</p>

    <h3>Kings Lynn 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>The goal drought (in the league anyway) continues with yet another 0-0 draw,&#xD;
this time away at King's Lynn.&#xD;
Once again we were very solid at the back, but to be honest we never looked like scoring. Forest Green stuff Gresley 5-1, and are beginning to pull away at the top.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Gloucester 1</h3>

    <p>Who says lightning doesn't strike twice? Just about everyone after&#xD;
Halesowen follow last year's amazing 5-4 victory over Gloucester with a depressing 1-0 loss at The Grove. A terrible defensive mix up led to the goal, but we didn't deserve much better.</p>

    <h3>FAC  Felixstowe 2 Yeltz 5</h3>

    <p>The road to Wem-ber-lee begins at local rivals Felixstowe with an emphatic&#xD;
5-2 victory, with all the goals coming in the first half. We also hit the woodwork four times, but the moaners come away happy saying we should have scored ten.</p>

    <h3>Crawley 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>Another 0-0 draw, this time against early pace-setters Crawley. Down to 6th place, and although we've only let in 4 goals in 7 games, we've only scored 8. Still got positive vibes though.</p>

    <h3>Burton 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>Halesowen come away from big-spending (well, you know!) Burton with a creditable 0-0 draw, leaving The Yeltz in 4th place.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 St Leonards 0</h3>

    <p>A 3-0 victory over bottom of the table St. Leonards pushes Halesowen up to third place. Goals from Piearce, Harrison and Cooper complete an easy victory to leave The Yeltz three points behind leader Forest Green.</p>

    <h3>Dorchester 2 Yeltz 0 Yeltz 3 Atherstone 1</h3>

    <p>Mixed fortunes - a first defeat at Dorchester (2-0) is followed by a home victory against Atherstone 3-1. We're 6th in the table behind Forest Green, Nuneaton (who beat Gresley 6-0!) and Crawley.</p>

    <h3>Gresley 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>A good point is earned at champions Gresley from a 1-1 draw.&#xD;
Halesowen had most of the game, and despite falling behind in the first half, fought back to gain a well-deserved point from an own goal.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Ashford 0</h3>

    <p>The Yeltz start the season in fine style by beating Ashford 1-0 at The Grove. Steve Piearce slotted the winner on a scorching day when The Yeltz turned on the style.</p>

    <h3></h3>

    <p>
  <p>There were quite a few personnel changes over the summer. The most notable absentee for the new season will be Evran Wright, who left for Telford just a week after signing a new contract. Also departing are Mick Shearer, Gary Hackett, Nick Colley and Mark Bellingham.</p>
  <p>New arrivals include Carlos De Azevedo, a Portugese Youth international,&#xD;
Steve Piearce from Doncaster, Luke Yates, James Tough and Adrian Cooper.</p>
  <p>The friendly results were mixed - we got stuffed 6-0 by the Albion, but&#xD;
beat Kiddy 1-0.</p>
