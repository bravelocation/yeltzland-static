    <h2><a href="/2005/09/27/YET%20ANOTHER%20DRAW.html">YET ANOTHER DRAW</a></h2>
    <h3>Evesham 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>With our 5th draw in 9 games, the mighty Yeltz are not surprisingly stuck lounging in mid-table in what's been a pretty disappointing start to the league season. At least we didn't throw the lead away this time, with Howard getting his first league goal to equalise an earlier Richard Ball goal for Evesham.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we host Chesham at The Grove. They've also had an average start to the year and are also mid-table (although above us in the table), so lets hope we can get all three points to keep us in touch.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Darren</h3>

  <p>Evesham United: Adey, Watson, Hamilton, Robinson, A Cooper, O'Toole, Blake, Hadland, Ball, Clarke (Hall 82), Martin (Pinkney 82). Unused subs: Bailey, Hands, Knurek</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman, Johnson, Haywood, Preston, Pope (c), I Cooper (Strachan 72), Cowley, Lamey, Forinton, N Smith, Forsdick. Unused subs: C Smith, Pierpoint, Skidmore, Jay</p>
  <p>Booked: Ball 62 Attendance: 200</p>
  <p>A disappointing draw was all both sides deserved in a poor game, although Evesham will have been more disappointed to have not got the three points after having the majority of the second half</p>
  <p>A scrappy start from both sides was a sign of things to come. Neither team could gain any control, although it was Halesowen who created the first couple of chances through a 6th minute Dave Hayward free kick which was taken well by Adey and then a 12th minute through ball from Cowley to Forsdick was cleared by the solid looking Evesham defence. Lamey then struck a free kick against the wall a minute later.</p>
  <p>Following a delay of a couple of minutes after Steve Pope was hit in the face by the ball on 16 minutes, Howard Forinton ran through but hit a weak shot at the keeper.</p>
  <p>A Lamey free kick swung in from the right was headed over by Forsdick on 29 minutes, and Forinton turned his defender on 35 minutes but shot just wide.&#xD;
From the goal kick the ball was allowed over Nick Preston's head and RICHARD BALL ran on to score past Coleman.</p>
  <p>On the stroke of half time, a Forsdick shot was defended for a corner. From this, Nick Smith headed into the ground but too powerfully and the ball went over.</p>
  <p>Straight from the kick off in the second half, a good move between Forinton and Lamey resulted in Smith being put clear, but his shot went straight at the keeper.</p>
  <p>Strong protests for a handball on 54 minutes by Karl Johnson were waved away by the referee as Ball hit wide.</p>
  <p>On 61 minutes Lamey managed to spring the offside trap but hit over from outside the area. Another long ball on 68 minutes fell to Forsdick, but the keeper cleared for a throw in.</p>
  <p>On 73 minutes a clearance from Coleman found HOWARD FORINTON who lobbed the keeper to score his first league goal for Halesowen. Three minutes later, Forsdick hit over after good work on the edge of the box.</p>
  <p>Evesham had a free kick by O'Toole on 81 minutes which was punched clear.&#xD;
With a minute to go Forinton hit the side netting after being put clear by a Pope clearance, but Halesowen were left with a fifth draw in a game they should have been expected to win.</p>

    <h3>FAC  Glapwell 0 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Our excellent FA Cup form under Paul Holleran continues with a 1-0 win over Glapwell of the Northern Counties East Premier League. A second half goal from Fozzy put us through to the 3rd Qualifying Round, and just 2 victories away from a place in the 1st Round proper. Draw on Monday, but let's hope for a home draw against lower league opposition!</p>
  <p>Other commitments have kept me away from Halesowen for a while, but I'm a bit concerned about what seems to be a general air of moaning (even more than usual!) about how things are going. I remember when the general spirit of the club was one of us all pulling together, but now all a lot of people seem to want to do is criticise the manager for not playing their preferred formation. Maybe I don't get a fair reflection of the feeling just through comments the web site, but it would be very sad if we lost the togetherness that always made Halesowen special. Anyway, that's enough my my rant - we have got an FA Cup victory away to tricky opposition to celebrate!</p>
  <p>We're back in league action on Tuesday when we travel down to Evesham. They've had a very average start, so it would be a good time for us to build on our good Cup form.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Glapwell: Sprigg; Robinson, D. Cooper, Grocutt, R. Smith, Walker, Davies, Trodden, Clarke, Magee (Hardwick 77), Castledine (Watson 82).  Unused Subs: Elliott, Wilson, West (GK)</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Johnson, Haywood, Preston, Pope, I. Cooper, Cowley (N. Smith 75), Lamey, Forinton, Amos, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Pierpoint, Strachan, Skidmore, Jay (GK)</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Foley (Sheffield)  Attendance: 171 Booked: Davies (43)</p>
  <p>Halesowen progressed to the 3rd qualifying round at Glapwell of the Northern Counties East League, but had no easy ride in an even contest.</p>
  <p>The tough-tackling hosts were marshalled in defence by former Yeltz assistant manager Darren Grocutt and easily found their stride going forward with Damien Magee firing at Dean Coleman in the 6th minute. The visiting defence then cleared a 14th minute cross from Mark Robinson and a 21st minute corner by veteran Gresley old-boy Gary Castledine.</p>
  <p>Halesowen played their new 4-4-2 formation and gradually improved as the half progressed with Simon Forsdick nipping in after 32 minutes only to see his shot deflected for a corner. Alex Cowley then surged from midfield on 40 minutes and squared the ball to Nathan Lamey but Dale Cooper made an important block in front of goal. Dave Haywood and Steve Pope then volleyed over Glapwell's bar but seconds before the interval Pope cleared at the other end after Coleman lost the ball to Rob Clarke in the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Glapwell continued to work hard at the start of the second half by forcing two early corners but also continued to pack their own defence with Howard Forinton crowded out after 51 minutes. Three minutes later home goalkeeper Louis Sprigg produced a fine save to tip Pope's header over the bar from Lamey's cross.</p>
  <p>With Glapwell starting to fancy their chances of producing a Cup shock, Magee struck inches wide in the 55th minute and Coleman collected Adam Walker's 64th minute lob. Clarke then put a good chance past the post from 12 yards after latching onto Nicki Preston's casual clearance.</p>
  <p>Gritty Glapwell's resistance was finally broken in the 73rd minute when FORSDICK ran on from midfield to drill a 20-yard shot into the corner of Sprigg's net. Halesowen were able to produce more clear-cut chances late on with Forinton heading Lamey's 79th minute corner over the bar. Forinton then set up substitute Nick Smith to place his shot but the ball rebounded off the left-hand upright and seconds later Lamey flashed a shot just wide.</p>
  <p>But in injury time Coleman broke Glapwell's hearts by making a crucial save at the foot of his post after referee Foley waved play on despite his assistant flagging for a foul.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Salisbury 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    A disappointing 1-0 defeat to early league leaders Salisbury means we're very much in  at this early stage. No lead to throw away this time, and from the brief account I have we didn't deserve anything more. See  for full details.
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Cooper (Johnson 75), Haywood, Preston, Pope, Farmer (Strachan 75), Cowley, Lamey, Forinton, N. Smith, Forsdick (C. Smith 82). Unused Subs: Pierpoint, Amos</p>
  <p>Salisbury City: Sawyer; Bartlett, Browne, Cook, Bond, Widdrington, Turk, Regis, Sales, Tubbs, Ferrett (Haddow 82). Unused Subs: Davis, Richardson, Holmes, Arthur</p>
  <p>Referee: L. Tavinder (Cheddleton, Staffs.)     Attendance: 401 Booked: Pope (73), Widdrington (79)</p>
  <p>Table-topping Salisbury underlined their promotion potential by ending Halesowen's six-game unbeaten run.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's Nathan Lamey was first to a long ball from Dave Haywood in the 5th minute but chipped wide of goalkeeper Kevin Sawyer.</p>
  <p>But the Yeltz barely tested Sawyer during an uneventful first half with the unbeaten Whites creating the better chances inspired by Christopher Ferrett down the left wing.</p>
  <p>Haywood cleared a Paul Sales header off the line in the 19th minute after Ferrett delivered Salisbury's first corner with the follow-up from Matthew Tubbs near the post turned away for a second corner. Home goalkeeper Dean Coleman took out a cross from Rene Regis on 23 minutes with Ferrett free in the centre and on 32 minutes Widdrington volleyed a part-cleared corner wide of the mark.</p>
  <p>Coleman easily collected a 35th minute looping header from Timothy Bond but Halesowen's defence was exposed again twice before the interval. A poor midfield pass from Nick Smith allowed Ferrett to find Tubbs but he flashed wide in the 38th minute and a couple of minutes later Coleman failed to gather a Sales header from Ferrett's corner but Bond put the rebound past the post.</p>
  <p>Halesowen displayed a little more urgency after half-time, but Ian Cooper's 48th minute shot was easily saved by Sawyer before a header from Tubbs dropped just over the bar at the other end.</p>
  <p>Sawyer produced an excellent save from Nathan Lamey's 55th minute shot from 20-yards after Steve Pope headed down in what proved to be Halesowen's best chance of the afternoon.</p>
  <p>On the hour Coleman beat away a rasping drive from Ferrett and then parried away a fierce drive from Tubbs at the near post four minutes later. Sandwiched in between, Steve Farmer's header struck the back of the net from Alex Cowley's cross but Howard Forinton had already impeded goalkeeper Sawyer and the goal was disallowed.</p>
  <p>Salisbury grabbed the winning goal in the 66th minute when SALES headed home directly from Ferrett's right-wing corner.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz looked happier after a late change of formation and enjoyed the majority of possession in the final minutes. Aaron Cook made an important clearance as Sawyer failed to gather Forinton's 72nd minute shot with Lamey bearing down on goal.</p>
  <p>However, it was man-of-the-match Ferrett who caused further confusion with a 74th minute cross and the visitors should have added a second goal in the 82nd minute when Tubbs screwed over the bar from close range.</p>

    <h3>FAC 1Q  Yeltz 5 South Normanton Athletic 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Now that's exciting. The mighty Yeltz started off on another FA Cup campaign with a 5-3 victory at home to South Normanton, with 4 goals from Howard Forinton - his first for the club. However, once again we didn't make it easy for ourselves after blowing an early 3-0 lead and letting the visitors come back to 3-3. Nathan got the other goal, and that puts us into the draw (which I assume is on Monday).</p>
  <p>Next Saturday league leaders Salisbury City are the visitors to The Grove. They're slightly surprising (to me anyway) leaders at this stage but they are unbeaten so it's not going to be easy. A victory would be very nice and keep up right up there at this early stage of the season.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Farmer (Pierpoint 90), Cowley (Johnson 85), Lamey, Forinton, N. Smith, Forsdick (Strachan 89). Unused Subs: Baker, Amos</p>
  <p>South Normanton Athletic: Boot; M. Smith (Cox 84), Jago, Peel, Atkinson, Walker, Robinson, Martt, Thorpe, Bedward (Augustus 55), Lewis. Unused Subs: Warden, Morrell, Roome</p>
  <p>Referee: D. Handley (Wigan)  Attendance: 279 Booked: Cox (90) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Howard Forinton</p>
  <p>Howard Forinton notched a hat-trick in seven minutes during the first-half but Halesowen were given a huge fright in progressing to the next round after squandering a three-goal lead to Northern Counties East Division 1 outfit, South Normanton Athletic.</p>
  <p>Halesowen piled on the early pressure with Alex Cowley shooting across goal in the 3rd minute after goalkeeper Steve Boot failed to clear a corner. After winning a series of corners, Dave Haywood then played an incisive 13th minute pass to Nathan Lamey, but his shot squirted wide and on 17 minutes Cowley struck the side-netting as a gulf in class started to look apparent.</p>
  <p>FORINTON inevitably opened the scoring in the 19th minute by touching the ball into the roof of the net from close range to record his first goal in Halesowen colours after Steve Pope was given a free header from a corner.</p>
  <p>Two minutes later Simon Forsdick made a great run down the left wing and set up FORINTON to increase the lead by striking the top corner of the net from the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>FORINTON completed his hat-trick with a simple tap-in after 26 minutes when Boot could only parry a shot from Nick Smith into his path.</p>
  <p>Pope and Lamey then wasted two free-kicks by blasting high and wide and in the 43rd minute Forsdick ballooned another good chance over the bar.</p>
  <p>With the floodgates looking ready to open, not even the most pessimistic Yeltz fan believed Halesowen could then throw away their comfortable three goal lead to a side languishing bottom of a league three rungs lower in the football pyramid.</p>
  <p>However, the Shiners were given at lifeline seconds before the interval when Nathan Robinson exposed Halesowen's weakness down the left wing and crossed for hard-working Anthony BEDWARD to convert an open goal from close range in their first real chance of the afternoon.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were given a further warning at the start of the second half when Nicki Preston made an important clearance and in the 59th minute the home defence was almost caught out when a long free-kick from John Peel was flicked over goalkeeper Dean Coleman by Carl Lewis but the ball fell just wide.</p>
  <p>The plucky visitors scored a second goal after 61 minutes when Lewis swung in a free-kick and captain PEEL buried a free header beyond Coleman amidst more woeful defending.</p>
  <p>Unbelievably, heartened South Normanton equalised in the 66th minute when Nick THORPE latched onto another long ball and held off two defenders before beating Coleman with an excellent finish from 12 yards to the delight of the travelling contingent.</p>
  <p>Halesowen redeemed themselves and reduced the tension with two further goals in the final minutes. LAMEY regained the lead with a low strike from 20 yards after Forinton laid the ball off in the 70th minute.</p>
  <p>Man-of-the-match FORINTON then planted home a 77th minute header from Haywood's deep cross to record his 4th goal of the game.</p>

    <h3>Grantham 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    Barbara that is - to help us hold a lead. By my reckoning (which is obviously suspect) we've been ahead in every game so far this season, and on Saturday it happened once again. A draw at Grantham isn't that bad, but we've unfortunately we seem to have settled in to our mid-table position despite only losing one game so far. Full details in .

<h3>Match Report from Darren</h3>

  <p>Halesowen:- Coleman, Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope (c), Farmer, Cowley, Lamey, Forinton, N Smith, Forsdick. Unused subs:- Maguire, Strachan, Johnson, Pierpoint, Baker</p>
  <p>Grantham:- Zicardi, Matthews, Weale, Sturgess, Julian, Brown, F Smith (Popple 72), Francis (c), Carruthers, Pell, Evans (Sneddon 72). Unused&#xD;
subs:- Wooding, Filby, Glover</p>
  <p>Attendance: 270</p>
  <p>Halesowen again failed to hold onto a lead against Grantham at the South Kesteven Stadium.</p>
  <p>After a quiet opening from both sides, Cowley put over a 6th minute corner which the keeper punched clear under pressure. A minute later Lamey was lucky to escape a caution with a late challenge on Steve Julian.</p>
  <p>A Willis Francis free kick on 18 minutes was struck tamely wide after an ill-advised Cowley throw in nearly let in a Grantham player who was fouled by the returning Dave Haywood.</p>
  <p>A Lamey free kick on 25 minutes by Lamey was just missed at the far post by a diving Steve Farmer, and on 36 Lamey was again the provider from the right to Howard Forinton who's header was well saved by the keeper.</p>
  <p>The second half began with Smith just hitting wide after good work from a Lamey free kick resulted in Farmer heading back across the goal.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz took the lead on 57 minutes when a great cross from Alex Cowley was headed home by NATHAN LAMEY. Again the Yeltz failed to capitalise and struggled to hold the ball during the closing stages, and from a long ball from the goalkeeper up the field, Pope and Farmer clashed to allow substitute MICHAEL SNEDDON to give Grantham a point.</p>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz had a reasonable holiday period, although as usual we always think we should have done better.</p>
  <p>
    On Saturday we took the lead away at Mangotsfield through a Nathan goal, although as has become a common occurance so far this year we couldn't hold on and ended up drawing. Then on Monday we just about held on to beat 10-man Rugby 3-2 despite being 3-1 up through Alex, Amos and Smith. At least it's entertaining! More details in Dave's .

  <p>Next Saturday we travel to Grantham for an early kickoff (1pm) due to England's game in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Coleman; Cooper, Forsdick, Preston, Pope, Farmer, Cowley, Lamey, Forinton, Smith, Amos. Unused Subs: Maguire, Johnson, Haywood, Skidmore, Pierpoint</p>
  <p>Rugby Town: Wilson; Tullin, Gordon, Peaks, Gould, Squire, Green, Cross (Nicholls 73), Slinn, Stone, D. Williams (S. Williams 87). Unused Subs: Maddox, Kattos, Wesley</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Hamilton (Cheltenham) Attendance: 375 Sent Off: Wilson (70) Booked: Forinton (43), Tullin (57)</p>
  <p>Halesowen made heavy weather of recording their first home win against 10-man Rugby in a game short on quality.</p>
  <p>An instantly forgettable opening was eventually brought to life after 28 minutes when Howard Forinton laid the ball off for Alex COWLEY to pick his spot and beat goalkeeper Steve Wilson from 15 yards. Cowley then struck wide on the half-hour and a minute later Simon Forsdick put Nathan Lamey clear but his shot was blocked after he side-stepped the last defender. Forsdick and Cowley were then blocked in front of goal and at the other end Steve Pope tidied up after Kevin Slinn clattered into young goalkeeper Dean Coleman as the visitors forced two 35th minute corners.</p>
  <p>Before the interval Rob Gould was dispossessed with Forinton hitting over the bar and Nick Smith rolled a shot past the post. Forinton then received a needless 43rd minute booking born out of his frustration before crossing inches too high for Lamey. Forinton's 45th minute right-wing cross was then met by a Lamey volley, but Wilson produced a magical save to keep the ball out.</p>
  <p>Halesowen increased their lead in the 55th minute when Rugby failed to clear Cowley's corner and Nick AMOS poked home from close range with a defender only helping the ball over the line.</p>
  <p>But Rugby were given hope when the home defence failed to pick up David Stone from a short corner and SQUIRE headed past Coleman at the near post in the 60th minute. The two-goal advantage was restored in simple fashion just a minute later when SMITH hooked into the net following a mix-up between goalkeeper Wilson and Andy Peakes.</p>
  <p>In a game with increasing tempo, Coleman seemed to have claimed a 63rd minute cross but then lost the ball with his defence clearing for a corner. With Rugby's defence looking fragile, Forsdick's 64th minute cross fell on top of the bar and Wilson saved well from Smith. Wilson then raced off his line in the 66th minute to save from Lamey following a defence-splitting pass from Forsdick.</p>
  <p>Rugby goalkeeper Wilson was dismissed with a red card in the 70th minute for handling inches outside his area as he attempted to save from Lamey and Chris Tullin took over in goal.</p>
  <p>But Halesowen failed to take advantage against the 10-men of Rugby and ended up suffering from more late jitters. Stone made a brilliant 80-yard full-length right-wing run in the 76th minute and the resulting cross from John Nicholls was missed by Coleman giving Kevin SLINN the easy task of reducing the arrears after the ball rebounded off the crossbar.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz failed to severely test Tullin although a 77th minute header from Steve Farmer was cleared off the line and an 80th minute shot from Pope was saved at the foot of the post. Lamey then made an 81st minute run and saw his shot diverted just past the post.</p>
  <p>Rugby had several chances to claim a dramatic late equaliser but Halesowen clung on with Coleman saving Squire's header at the second attempt in the 90th minute.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper (Skidmore 73), Forsdick, Preston, Pope, Farmer, Cowley, Lamey (Hay 83), Smith (Strachan 73), Forinton, Amos. Unused Subs: Maguire, Johnson</p>

Booked: Farmer (38), Sullivan (69)    Sponsors' Man of the Match: Steve Farmer</p>
  <p>Halesowen squandered another potential win and failed to defend their fourth lead in four games when unbeaten Banbury grabbed two dramatic late equalisers.</p>
  <p>The evening looked promising when Nick Amos headed a Nathan Lamey cross over the bar in the 3rd minute and Steve Farmer met Simon Forsdick's cross to head against the crossbar with low-key Howard Forinton striking the side-netting from close range against his former club in the 5th minute. Andrew Baird then glanced a header wide for the visitors after 6 minutes.</p>
  <p>Forsdick skipped down the left wing in the 11th minute but his cross was just too high for Nick Smith and after 19 minutes Banbury's John Gardner beat Alex Cowley but Baird flashed another header over the bar from the resulting cross.</p>
  <p>Cowley's 20th minute cross was again met by a Farmer header but goalkeeper Simon Tricker and defender Darren Pond somehow clawed the ball away from the foot of the post before Lamey's 21st minute close range effort was diverted for a corner.</p>
  <p>Chris Jackson hit a speculative 35-yard half-volley just wide for the Puritans after 26 minutes and three minutes later Halesowen's Smith shot wide after Forinton headed down Cowley's cross.</p>
  <p>Just before the interval Banbury enjoyed a good spell with Baird heading a Paul Lamb cross into the arms of Chris Taylor. Two minutes later Taylor flapped at Lamb's free-kick but the ball fell safely and on 45 minutes Gardner also blasted wide.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz grabbed the lead in the 51st minute when Steve Pope touched a 22-yard free-kick for LAMEY to strike a low-ball beyond Tricker through a crowded goal-mouth.</p>
  <p>But hopes of a first home win were disappointed as Halesowen failed to capitalise in a game resembling a mid-table clash.</p>
  <p>Forsdick fed Smith on the hour, but he shot straight at Tricker from 20-yards. Forinton then put Forsdick clear on goal after 78 minutes, but he lofted the ball over the bar. Two minutes later Lamey latched onto a headed clearance from Nicki Preston but his chip fell on top of the cross-bar with goalkeeper Tricker beaten. Substitute Gary Hay looked raw when he was put through in the 84th minute and he wasted the chance through indecision before the ball broke for fellow substitute Craig Strachan to fire in a fierce 20-yard shot that was parried away by Tricker.</p>
  <p>Halesowen twice paid the price for not securing the points in a dramatic final few minutes as Banbury's substitutes rose to the occasion to force two equalising goals. Substitute Neil King delivered a cross from the right wing for substitute Tommy KINCH to head home at the far post with Taylor failing to prevent the ball rolling inches over the goal-line after 85 minutes.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were given a 'get-out-of-jail' card in the 87th minute when they regained the lead with FARMER crashing the ball into the net from close range after Tricker failed to gather Strachan's free-kick. Gardner hit a 20-yard free-kick over the Yeltz bar on 90 minutes and it appeared that Halesowen's defence had survived.</p>
  <p>However, play was allowed to continue deep into injury time - despite neither physio being required in the second-half - and in the 95th minute King delivered an identical right-wing cross for substitute Chris POTTER to be given yet another far-post free-header to take home a share of the points.</p>

  <p>Things haven't started exactly how we imagined - when do they ever? - but the slightly rocky start to the season got a lot better after a good 1-0 victory away to King's Lynn.</p>

  <p>Our next game is on Tuesday at home to Banbury. They've had a pretty good start with two wins and a loss, but I'd hope we can build on Saturday's victory and keep in touch with the early leaders.</p>

    <h3>Friendly  Boldmere 2 Yeltz 4</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz completed their pre-season friendlies with another win, but the week was overshadowed by the sad and untimely death of Steve Parkes. There have lots of kind comments on , but I just want to repeat how much Steve will be missed on this site and down The Grove.
    
  </p>
  <p>On to happier thoughts. Our pre-season preparations appear to have gone well, and from the other end of the country I think the squad has definitely been strengthened over the summer. Forinton will hopefully become the regular goal scorer we've been missing for a while, and Farmer seems a good signing at the back. I'm very confident we can make the play-offs at least, although I always am confident this time of year.</p>
  <p>I've cleverly arranged my summer holidays for the first week of the season, so updates after next Saturday may be slightly slower than usual and I won't see you all at the Hitchin game. Let's hope for a good start to the season and three points to get our challenge on its' way.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Darren</h3>

  <p>BOLDMERE ST MICHAELS team:- Anstiss (Clarke 85); Curtin, Brough, Price (Fisher 70), Mark Smith, Steve Smith, Grosvenor (Thomas 70), Seward, Beckley (Tyrrell H/T), Charley (Packer 75), Kirk Smith</p>
  <p>HALESOWEN TOWN team:- Taylor; Cowley (Skidmore H/T), Maguire, Preston, Pope (Johnson 66), Farmer (Pierpoint 59); Smith, Amos, Cooper; Lamey (Hay H/T), Forinton (Lamey 66)</p>
  <p>Halesowen completed a fine pre-season with their 5th consecutive win against a very competitive and sometimes physical Midland Alliance team.</p>
  <p>It was the opposition who had the first chance on 10 minutes when Mykel Beckley blazed over after good work on the edge of the penalty area.</p>
  <p>A minute later and the Yeltz took the lead. Boldmere appealed in vain for the offside flag as NATHAN LAMEY broke clear from a Cooper through ball and slotted home left footed into the corner of former Redditch goalkeeper Richard Anstiss' net.</p>
  <p>Beckley was again a threat on 16 minutes, but was brought down by Preston as he broke through from midfield. The resulting free kick was well saved by Taylor.</p>
  <p>Halesowen won a free kick on 22 minutes, and from it Nathan Lamey set up NICK SMITH who guided the ball into the back of the net with a glancing header to put Halesowen 2-0 up.</p>
  <p>Boldmere were given a lifeline on 24 minutes as the referee awarded a penalty for a Pope challenge. KEVIN CHARLEY slotted home. A minute later and the Mikes were level as MYKEL BECKLEY broke free and slotted home past Taylor.</p>
  <p>After conceding two goals in the space of a minute, Halesowen tried to recover as Steve Pope struck tamely wide from a free kick.</p>
  <p>A deep corner on 37 minutes from Alex Cowley was missed by everyone in the area. However 2 minutes later HOWARD FORINTON capped a great personal pre-season as he lobbed over the goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area to restore Halesowen's lead.</p>
  <p>The second half began with Pope attempting an audacious lob from a free kick on the half way line that went just wide. The game sparked into life on 51 minutes as Farmer was left on the ground after an off the ball incident with substitue Justin Tyrrell. After consulting his assistant, the referee had no option but to show the red card.</p>
  <p>Halesowen controlled the rest of the game with their man advantage and went further into the lead on 59 minutes as a Pope free kick was initially saved by the keeper only for NICK AMOS to score from the rebound.</p>
  <p>Lamey nearly added to his tally when a short corner to Cooper was played back to him and hit a shot just wide. Nick Smith also hit just over on 73 minutes after good work in midfield.</p>

    <h3>Friendly  Solihull 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz continued their impressive pre-season form with a 2-0 win against last year's bottom team Solihull. Goals from Nathan and Forinton keeps our winning run going, and perhaps even more importantly yet another clean sheet. Full details in .
    
  </p>
  <p>Only two weeks to go now, and just the one friendly left - next Saturday away to Boldmere.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Darren</h3>

  <p>Halesowen ran out comfortable winners at Damson Parkway against a competitive Solihull Borough side showing many changes from the team relegated from last year's Southern League Premier Division.</p>
  <p>Halesowen threatened first on the right in the 8th minute as a cross from Nathan Lamey was headed at keeper Bray to make a good save from Stuart Pierpoint. Pope then headed another Lamey cross, this time from the left, well over on 17 minutes.</p>
  <p>Lamey was again involved on 22 minutes as he shot wide after good work with Nick Smith. Solihull rarely threatened the Yeltz goal although they had plenty of possession.</p>
  <p>Lamey put over a good ball to Smith, who headed back for Forinton to win a corner on 23 minutes, before Solihull broke on 27 minutes as Egan shot against his own player wide after good work by Wellington on the wing.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally took the lead on 44 minutes when good work in the box allowed NATHAN LAMEY to break free and slot home.</p>
  <p>The second half began brightly for the Yeltz, and on 59 minutes, Howard Forinton struck a shot against Bray that was well saved after good work between Forinton and a fit again Strachan.</p>
  <p>On 65 minutes, good work on the right by Wellington allowed himself time to put in a deep cross that was well gathered by Town keeper Chris Taylor.</p>
  <p>A minute later and HOWARD FORINTON added to his pre-season goal tally when Pope played a deep ball to him from the right and the new signing was able to lift the ball into the net over an advancing Bray.</p>
  <p>The rest of the game saw several more replacements for both sides as Halesowen held on comfortably for a fourth consecutive pre-season win and a third clean sheet in those four games.</p>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz continued their good run of pre-season results with a 1-0 win at home to Nuneaton. Another goal from new bloke Steve Farmer clinched what sounds like a hard-fought victory in .

</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Johnson, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Farmer, Smith, Lamey, Amos, Forinton, Cooper. Used Subs: Skidmore, O'Brien, Pierrepoint, Teraud, Forsdick, Harper.</p>
  <p>Nuneaton Borough: Acton; Oddy, Holmes, Reeves, Wilkin, Love, Collins, Noon, Frew, Quailey, Staff. Subs: Fitzpatrick, Breward, Blenkinsopp, Murphy, Saunders, Spencer, Poole (GK).</p>
  <p>Referee: R. Smith (Halesowen)  Attendance: 210</p>
  <p>Steve Farmer buried a second-half header to inflict the first pre-season defeat on his former Conference North team-mates.</p>
  <p>Roger Ashby's Nuneaton dominated the opening-half, with Halesowen struggling to make any impression in midfield. A neat interchange almost let in David Staff in the 7th minute and two minutes later Staff hit just wide from a 20-yard free-kick. On 18 minutes another free-kick on the edge of Halesowen's penalty area was wasted by Martin Reeves.</p>
  <p>Rob Oddy left the field after receiving lengthy treatment to a head injury following an unnecessary challenge by Dave Haywood on the half-hour. Five minutes before the delayed interval Brian Quailey almost met Michael Frew's cross before Frew fired a shot at home goalkeeper Chris Taylor just before the half-time whistle.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz enjoyed a much better second-half with Ian Cooper's drive saved low-down by Darren Acton in the 46th minute and after a lull in proceedings, Nathan Lamey blasted wide on the hour.</p>
  <p>Former Halesowen midfielder Andy Spencer was introduced as a Nuneaton substitute in the 58th minute after recovering from his lengthy injury and on 67 minutes Taylor raced out of goal to save at the feet of another Nuneaton substitute, Rich Saunders.</p>
  <p>A Simon Forsdick cross was headed away for a corner on 70 minutes with Farmer forcing a save from substitute goalkeeper Ryan Poole at his post. FARMER then found himself in space to head home the winning goal in the 72nd minute following a deep cross from Lamey. Lamey was then invited to leave the pitch together with Gary Fitzpatrick by the referee following a touchline skirmish two minutes later.</p>
  <p>Nuneaton created their best chance with seven minutes remaining when highly rated 18-year old substitute David Blenkinsopp flashed a header against the crossbar and Spencer stabbed the rebound wide.</p>

    <h3>Friendly  Yeltz 4 WBA 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz turned in another four goal performance in beating a reserve Albion side 4-3 last night at The Grove. Coming from behind three times, and Howard Forinton scoring what sounds like an impressive hat-trick, all in all it's another promising pre-season performance.</p>
  <p>Next game is on Saturday, again at The Grove, when Nuneaton are the visitors.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: C. Taylor; Johnson, Forsdick, Preston, Pope, Farmer, Cooper, Lamey, Smith, Forinton, O'Brien. Subs: Amos, Teraud, Skidmore, Harper, Haywood, Garvey (GK).</p>
  <p>West Bromwich Albion XI: Daniels; Hodgkiss, A. Triallist, Forsyth, Darg, Davies, Smikle, Pringle, Elvins, Nicholson, Humphrey. Subs: Kelleher, Downing, McGovern, McDonald, McQuilkin</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Hendley (Sandwell)  Attendance: 436</p>
  <p>Halesowen came from behind three times to run out narrow winners in a seven-goal thriller against a lively youth and reserve squad representing the Baggies</p>
  <p>Albion took the lead after just 28 seconds when last season's leading reserve team goal-scorer Rob ELVINS met a cross from Jared Hodgkiss and his header looped into the net.</p>
  <p>Howard Forinton hit a 20-yard drive just wide in the 5th minute but FORINTON then equalised in the 14th minute by unleashing a tremendous 20-yard finish after strike partner Nathan Lamey headed on.</p>
  <p>Chris Taylor saved from Elvins in the 16th minute and three minutes later free-kick specialist Rob Davies curled a 20-yard dead-ball kick just around the post. In a 26th minute break, Forinton combined with Lamey again but struck straight at goalkeeper Luke Daniels. Taylor then saved a 32nd minute volley from Brian Smikle and instinctively kept out the follow-up from Davies.</p>
  <p>The West Brom youngsters regained the lead on 34 minutes when Stuart NICHOLSON slotted home at the second attempt after his first shot was well blocked by Taylor.</p>
  <p>FORINTON levelled for the second time for Halesowen on the stroke on half-time by staying on-side from a long ball and lobbing goalkeeper Daniels when clear on goal.</p>
  <p>At the start of the second period Lamey's shot was turned for a corner and Daniels collected Nicki Preston's header from Forinton's cross. Another Forinton strike was blocked on the hour before a good turn from Ben Pringle set up NICHOLSON to convert his second goal and put the visitors back in front after 61 minutes.</p>
  <p>But Halesowen finished with a flourish and Daniels was forced into a fine 64th minute save after Lamey was left in space following a defensive slip-up. LAMEY then punished more defensive hesitancy a couple of minutes later to slam home Halesowen's third equaliser from a narrow angle.</p>
  <p>Two minutes from time, FORINTON completed his hat-trick by turning Jeff Forsyth and drilling home the winner under Daniels from 12 yards.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Things are still OK in the world. The indomitable Yeltz gained their first victory of the season with a convincing 4-0 win over local rivals Stourbridge Town. Goals from The Pope, new bloke Steve Farmer and two from Nathan on a very hot afternoon clinched a comfortable and satisfying victory.</p>
  <p>Our next fixture is now on Tuesday when the Albion visit The Grove in our traditional pre-season friendly.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: C. Taylor; Johnson, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Farmer, Amos, Forinton, Smith, Hay, Forsdick. Second Half Subs: Lamey, Cooper, O'Brien, Paszkowec, Harper.</p>
  <p>Stourbridge: Evans; Southwick, Wood, Broadhurst, Bennett, Oliver, Heath, Field, Bellingham, Gennard, Rogers. Subs: R. Taylor, Wright, Ford, Rock, Hollick, Brown</p>
  <p>Referee: D. Gratton (Solihull)  Attendance: 257</p>
  <p>Two goals in each half gave Halesowen a comfortable victory over Midland Alliance neighbours Stourbridge.</p>
  <p>New home striker Gary Hay caught the eye early on by turning cleverly on the edge of the penalty area before thundering a 5th minute shot just wide. Nick Smith then drove just wide from 15 yards in the 22nd minute but two minutes later goalkeeper Chris Taylor was forced to race out and save at the feet of Mark Bellingham to deny the Glassboys.</p>
  <p>Halesowen took the lead on the half-hour when Smith's cross was flicked onto the crossbar and last season's leading goalscorer Steve POPE turned the ball home from close range. Two minutes later former Nuneaton defender Steve FARMER rose to glance home a header from Simon Forsdick's corner. Five minutes before the interval Hay battled through the visiting defence but blasted the ball over the bar.</p>
  <p>Substitute striker Nathan Lamey showed his class by adding two further second-half goals. Bellingham hit weakly wide for Stourbridge in the 53rd minute but Lamey turned well in the Stourbridge area three minutes later to fire just wide.</p>
  <p>LAMEY drilled home Halesowen's third goal into the bottom corner from 15 yards on 64 minutes and twelve minutes later a fit-looking LAMEY latched onto a long ball out of defence and calmly prodded his second goal past goalkeeper Paul Evans.</p>
  <p>Sandwiched between Lamey's goals, Jamie Oliver stabbed wide of an empty net for Stourbridge after Chris Taylor failed to gather Leon Broadhurst's 68th minute corner. In the dying minutes Nick Preston and Smith both went close for the hosts.</p>

  <p>Halesowen Town: C. Taylor; Johnson, Haywood, Farmer, Pope, Cooper, Cowley, Lamey, Smith, Forinton, Forsdick. Second Half Subs: Hay, Amos, O'Brien, Teraud, Warner, Lewis (GK).</p>
  <p>Walsall First Half: Oakes; Pead, Fox, Gerrard, Westwood, Osborn, Darius Larossa, Wrack, Wright, Taylor, Bradley</p>

  <p>Referee: A. Marriner (Coventry) Attendance: 760</p>
  <p>Walsall brought a full squad to the Grove to give both sides their first full pre-season work out.</p>
  <p>Craig Pead's early cross from the right was headed wide by Darren Wrack and in the 17th minute Dave Haywood's corner was punched clear by Walsall goalkeeper Andy Oakes at the other end.</p>
  <p>Pead's drive was then beaten away by home goalkeeper Chris Taylor on 23 minutes before the Saddlers took a 27th minute lead when a shot from Daniel Fox fell for new Brazilian striker Ruben 'Darius' LAROSSA to round Chris Taylor and score from 8 yards out.</p>
  <p>Oakes turned away a fierce 28th minute shot from a fit-looking Nathan Lamey at the foot of the post but with Walsall moving into their stride Kris Taylor found space in the area after 34 minutes but his volley was unknowingly blocked by well-positioned Chris Taylor.</p>
  <p>Walsall increased the lead in the 43rd minute when another Pead cross was met with a glancing header into the net from Kris TAYLOR.</p>
  <p>A much-changed second-half Walsall line-up saw Jorge Leitao lead the line as the solitary striker in a 5-4-1 formation and in the 57th minute Julian Bennett's header was scrambled clear. Halesowen substitute goalkeeper Carl Lewis made a flying save in the 77th minute to deny Michael Tuohy from 20 yards and in the 82nd minute Steve Pope headed off his own line from Leitao's effort.</p>
  <p>Halesowen went close in the 84th minute but Walsall added a third goal with two minutes remaining when Pope shielded a through-ball from Lee Vaughan but goalkeeper Lewis was slow to collect and LEITAO nipped in to roll the ball into the unguarded net.</p>

    <p>
  <p>It's July, which means thoughts finally start turning to the pre-season friendlies and the new season. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>There's been some activity within the the squad so far - mainly up front where Jason and Jimmy have left us with Howard Forinton and Gary Hay joining us to form what will hopefully be a more productive front-line (with Nathan) than last season. It's a shame in particular to see Jason go, but he was well below his previous form last year so it makes sense (to me anyway!)</p>
  <p>
    Friendlies start on July 13th at The Grove when Walsall are the visitors, and we have a pretty decent set of  arranged.
    
  </p>
  <p>The draws for the FA Cup and the Trophy have also been made, and miracle of miracles we've got home draws! FA Cup 1QR gives us South Normanton Athletic or Arnold Town, and in the Trophy we've got Willenhall.</p>
  <p>I'm very much looking forward to the new season, where I hope we can build on the progress we made last year and challenge strongly for promotion. I'm also hoping that there'll be a lot less moaning this year and people will appreciate a bit more what a great club we are, but I'm not holding my breath :-(</p>

    In the end even a win wouldn't have made any difference, but it was still a disappointing end to the season when we lost to Team Bath to only end up in .

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Johnson, Haywood (Cooper 65), Preston, Pope, N. Smith (Skidmore 81), Cowley, Moore, Lamey, Amos (Baker 81), Forsdick. Unused Sub: Gayle</p>
  <p>Team Bath: Hines; D. Smith, Townley, Long, Hudson, Ball, Heiniger, Canham (Wojciechowski 73), Kamara-Taylor, Blake (Lewis 77), Warner. Unused Subs: Maye, Jaukovic, Chitty</p>
  <p>Referee: P. Caswell (Leicester)  Attendance: 547  Booked: None&#xD;
 &#xD;
Sponsors' Man of the Match: Simon Forsdick</p>
  <p>Halesowen missed out on the play-offs and slipped down to 9th place in the final table after their University-funded visitors completed the double.</p>
  <p>It proved to be a disappointing end to a season of early promise and the day started badly after the first-team kit went missing, presumed to be stolen. Prior to the game, captain Steve Pope was named as the Player of the Season ahead of Simon Forsdick and Alex Cowley and the Halesowen Town Supporters Travel Club presented a cheque for £1000 to the club.</p>
  <p>Nathan Lamey found himself in space after just 6 minutes for white-shirted Halesowen after being put through by Alex Cowley but could only toe-poke at goalkeeper Ali Hines from five yards out. Team Bath then produced a good move on 20 minutes when David Blake flashed just wide after being set up by Matt Warner and Joe Long.</p>
  <p>Jason Moore was caught offside on 21 minutes and in the 25th minute a Cowley cross was headed back across goal but Moore tried to place his header and his effort was cleared off the line. Caleb Kamara-Taylor headed just wide for the visitors after 28 minutes and in the 39th minute Halesowen man-of-the-match Simon Forsdick burst down the left-wing to earn a corner.&#xD;
Lamey then cut in from the right in the 40th minute but Hines produced a fine save to punch clear his 20-yard drive and then repeated the trick from the same player a minute later.</p>
  <p>The visitors grabbed the winning goal in first-half injury time when Blake crossed for Matt WARNER to head home.</p>
  <p>Halesowen never looked likely to break down well-organised Team Bath in the second half and it was Marc Canham who struck the side-netting from ten yards for the visitors in the 57th minute. A casual back-pass from Karl Johnson then let in Kamara-Taylor but his clever chip rebounded off the Halesowen crossbar with goalkeeper Chris Taylor beaten.</p>
  <p>Forsdick won a couple of corners for the increasingly desperate hosts and in the 76th minute Hines turned a 20-yard Lamey drive around the post. But Team Bath remained good value for their victory to claim a creditable mid-table league position as Halesowen's season petered out bereft of ideas.</p>

    <h3>Hitchin 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It was never going to be easy. The topsy-turvy season continues down to the wire as we could only draw at Hitchin, dropped down to 7th but still have a reasonable chance of getting into the end of season playoffs.</p>
  <p>Dave's match report explains the details of a lacklustre performance on Saturday, but the situation now is this. We MUST win on Saturday against Team Bath at The Grove, and hope at least two of Merthyr, Hednesford, Bedford and Tiverton don't win (not that unlikely). Also, Bath are only one worse goal difference than us so a big win for them could put them above us. However with rumours of illegible players for Bedford even all this isn't clear! Calculators at the ready.</p>
  <p>Obviously all we can do is win next week and hope for the best, but we've been in this situation before (when we won but unfortunately other results went against us!) but we WILL win on Saturday and for some strange reason I think we've going to be lucky.</p>
  <p>BELIEVE!</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Hitchin Town: Wilmot; Baldry, Kidd (Lamacraft HT), Ayres, McCulloch, Cavill, Hassan, McMenamin, Sozzo, Lewis, Bridge. Unused Subs: Hill, Duffy, Mills, Burke</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Skidmore, Haywood (Johnson 13), Preston, Pope, Smith, Cowley, Moore (Baker 82), Haarhoff (Lamey 66), Amos, Forsdick. Unused Sub: Gayle.</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Francis (Little Downham, Cambs)           Attendance: 417</p>
  <p>Injury-hit Halesowen dropped out of the play-off places after letting ineffective Hitchin off the hook by failing to hold onto a crucial lead.</p>
  <p>A win would have put Halesowen up to 3rd and in the driving seat for home play-off game but Hitchin's equaliser meant Halesowen slipped to 7th place to join three other teams on 66 points. On the bright side, victory in the final home game against Team Bath would mean Halesowen skipping above any of the 4 teams above them that only manage a draw. Rumours also emerged that, subject to appeal, Bedford will be docked a point for an administrative irregularity. Clearly, once the disappointment of throwing away victory by gifting Hitchin one of the sloppier goals of the season had passed, there remained plenty to play for on the final Saturday of a season of twists and turns.</p>
  <p>A disappointing game with both sides requiring points for different reasons at the opposite ends of the table started quietly with a total lack of early action. Dave Haywood limped off injured on 13 minutes, but the period of scrappy play continued until the first chance of the game in the 20th minute when Hitchin's Josh Sozzo hit a half-volley over the bar. A minute later home goalkeeper Richard Wilmot punched clear Alex Cowley's long throw-in. Halesowen then came to life and enjoyed a good spell of pressure in the 23rd minute when Jimmy Haarhoff crossed from the right but the Hitchin defence cleared off the toe of Simon Forsdick. After clever foot-work from Cowley and Haarhoff, the home defence then cleared another Forsdick effort off the line. On the half-hour, Steve Pope worked his way down the left wing to earn a corner, but Cowley's kick was taken well by Wilmot.</p>
  <p>A long clearance from Wilmot found Sozzo in the 34th minute but substitute Karl Johnson tidied up and a minute after the interval Halesowen goalkeeper Chris Taylor blocked from Mark Bridge although the assistant referee had already flagged for offside.</p>
  <p>Halesowen grabbed the vital lead in a game of few chances in the 52nd minute when Wilmot dropped the ball under pressure from Steve Pope from a long free-kick and the ball fell kindly for FORSDICK to side-foot home into the empty net from a wide angle. A minute later Forsdick broke down the left and set up Jason Moore to cross dangerously, but the ball ran across the Hitchin area without a supporting striker in sight and Halesowen missed the opportunity to increase the lead that their overall performance did not deserve.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz surrendered the lead in the 60th minute when a disputed long free-kick from Chris McMenamin was missed by goalkeeper Taylor and BRIDGE headed home to guarantee safety from relegation for the Canaries.</p>
  <p>Jaded Halesowen never looked like restoring the lead necessary to secure a play-off position and little was seen of their attack after Haarhoff was substituted in the 66th minute. Johnson's weak 25-yard shot was easily saved by Wilmot on 83 minutes but the hosts almost snatched a last minute winner when goalkeeper Taylor elected to head the ball clear and only managed to set up Aaron Cavill to launch a long range shot. However, Taylor raced back and redeemed himself by saving at the foot of the post.</p>

    <h3>WSC Final 2L  Yeltz 2 Studley 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's always nice to win something, so congratulations to the players and management for winning the Worcester Senior Cup! Two goals from Alex clinched the two-legged final 3-1 last night, and sets us up nicely for the final run-in in the League.</p>
  <p>
    On Saturday we play the first of our crucial last two games away to . With Merthyr winning on Monday it's even , but it's still in our hands and we are guaranteed a playoff spot with two wins. Hitchin are still in danger of going down, so it's going to be a battle.
    
  </p>
  <p>I hear the "fancy dress" theme this year is to wear blue - a pretty radical idea but I think it'll work. I'm sure there'll be an excellent turnout (even a part-timer like me is going!) and let's hope for three more points and a very exciting end to what's been a great season so far.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Skidmore, Baker, Preston, Pope, Smith, Cowley, Moore, Haarhoff, Amos, Forsdick (Lamey 69). Unused Subs: Haywood, Bowater, Gayle</p>
  <p>Studley FC: C. Johnson; Cross, Strain, Dyer (Whittington HT), Walsh, Blake, Ager, Savery, Jones (Rattray 40), Grubb, Neath (Fleetwood HT). Unused Subs: Styles, A. Johnson</p>
  <p>Referee: J. Cox (Evesham)      Attendance: 349&#xD;
 Sent Off: Rattray (85)              Sponsors' Man of the Match: Alex Cowley</p>
  <p>Halesowen lifted the Worcestershire Senior Cup for the second time in three years with two goals from man-of-the-match Alex Cowley finally ending Studley's stubborn resistance.</p>
  <p>Voting for Player of the Season took place during the game and although Cowley seemed unlikely to win, he has appeared in more games than any other player during the season in notching his 11th goal. Dave Haywood was named in the starting line-up but injured a hamstring in the pre-match warm up and was replaced by Lewis Baker as Halesowen's remaining squad resembled the walking wounded.</p>
  <p>Cowley's 10th minute left-wing corner was met by a Nick Amos header but Richard Strain cleared off the line near the foot of his post. COWLEY then gave the Yeltz a 14th minute lead with a superb bending and dipping shot from the edge of the penalty area to leave goalkeeper Craig Johnson standing.</p>
  <p>Kevin Jones caused problems for Halesowen in the first leg 1-1 draw but was substituted in the 40th minute following an injury. Within a minute Studley's Anthony Savery crossed from the right and goalkeeper Chris Taylor saved the day as defender Stuart Skidmore rattled his own crossbar with a header under pressure from Andrew Grubb with Grubb only able to flick the rebound over the bar.</p>
  <p>At the start of the second half Jimmy Haarhoff's looping shot was collected by visiting goalkeeper Craig Johnson and seven minutes later Johnson saved Cowley's shot in a crowded penalty area.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz added the second goal of the evening in the 66th minute when Simon Forsdick made a superb run down the left wing and crossed for COWLEY to follow up from close range after Johnson made a fine save from Nick Smith's header.</p>
  <p>Johnson then saved from substitute Nathan Lamey in the 70th minute after Steve Pope hit a direct free-kick into the Studley defensive wall. Vincent Rattray was sent off for fouling Lamey when clear on goal with five minutes remaining but Pope's resulting free-kick was deflected over the bar.</p>

    <h3>Grantham 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz gained a crucial three points with a vital 2-0 victory at Grantham, and with some other results going our way we can now guarantee a play-off spots by winning our last two games.</p>
  <p>It appears it was a pretty convincing victory on Saturday, and it's excellent to see Jason scoring once again. So it's on to Hitchin next week (definitely rearranged) in a very important last away game - or hopefully not! Not sure there are many plans for fancy dress this year, but it's going to be an excellent day out.</p>
  <p>Before that we have the distraction of the Worcester Senior Cup Final on Tuesday at The Grove against Studley. It's 1-1 from the first leg, and although it would be great to win something the most important thing is everyone remains fit for the remaining league games.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Grantham Town: Duffy; Wooding, Weale, Sturgess, Julian, Steed, Evans, Francis, White, Matthews (Glover 45), Hallows (F. Smith 45). Unused Subs: Quailey, Sneddon, Fox.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Skidmore, Haywood (Baker), Preston, Pope, N. Smith, Cowley, Moore, Haarhoff, Amos, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Johnson, Lamey</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Jones (Biggleswade)         Attendance: 371</p>
  <p>Halesowen boosted their play-off hopes by moving into 4th spot in the league with a comfortable victory at the South Kesteven Stadium in Lincolnshire.</p>
  <p>Grantham's Tim Wooding blasted a shot wide on 13 minutes but it was the visitors who took a 2-0 first half lead after a good opening 45 minutes.</p>
  <p>The opening goal came on 21 minutes when Jimmy Haarhoff worked down the right and sent in a low cross for Jason MOORE to convert his first league goal for five months. Two minutes later Dave Haywood was allowed to advance but shot just wide.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz added a second goal on 30 minutes following a mistake by the home goalkeeper. Ayden Duffy beat a Nick Smith shot away and from Haywood's corner Duffy could only parry away Haarhoff's weak shot and leading marksman Steve POPE was on hand to turn the ball home.</p>
  <p>Grantham seemed to have found a way back into the game on 53 minutes when Stuart Skidmore was penalised for handling the ball in the area from a throw-in. However, Halesowen escaped when Jason White could only watch his penalty kick being tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Chris Taylor.</p>
  <p>On the hour Simon Forsdick's headed just wide from another Haywood corner as Halesowen remained good value for their vital three points.</p>
