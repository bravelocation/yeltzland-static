    <h3>Yeltz 1 King's Lynn 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz gained a critical three points with a deserved 1-0 victory against King's Lynn at The Grove. The winning goal was a Nathan penalty just before half-time which also resulted in a King's Lynn player getting sent off. Full details as ever in  Dave's match report .</p>
  <p>With other results going reasonably well for us we're back in 5th place in the table, and with only three games to go still have a good chance of reaching those play-offs. Our next game is on Saturday when we visit Grantham in a game we simply must get something out of.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Skidmore, Haywood, Preston, Amos, Smith, Cowley, Moore, Lamey (Haarhoff 62), Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Pope, Johnson, Gayle</p>
  <p>King's Lynn: Wilson; Camm, Blake (Quistin 49), McMahon, Hammond, Clark, Defty, Harvey, Hay (Staff 66), Bloomfield, Angel. Unused Subs: O'Halloran, Forshaw, McAnally.</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Robins (Bristol) Attendance: 502 Booked: Defty (80), Forsdick (83) Sent Off: Harvey (43) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Simon Forsdick</p>
  <p>Halesowen moved back into a play-off position after completing the double against in-form Kings Lynn, who were reduced to ten men for the whole of the second half.</p>
  <p>Stuart Skidmore put in a notable performance for hard-working Halesowen in a man-to-man marking role on Danny Bloomfield that saw the league's second highest scorer restricted to only a couple of chances. Once again the Halesowen substitute's bench could only boast one fully fit member, with Steve Pope still recovering from midweek concussion. Pope however, has pledged his future to the Yeltz by signing a new contract for next season.</p>
  <p>Halesowen started in eager fashion and in the 3rd minute a right-wing corner from Dave Haywood was headed on by Lewis Baker but Jason Moore's shot was deflected onto the roof of the net and a minute later Nick Smith headed an Alex Cowley corner just wide. On 10 minutes Nathan Lamey was just beaten to a through ball from Simon Forsdick before Forsdick skipped down the left wing only to see his cross cleared by the visiting defence. Danny Hammond then made a crucial challenge in the 18th minute to take the ball off Lamey's toe in front of goal after Moore helped on another Cowley cross.</p>
  <p>The Linnets won their first corner in the 21st minute and a minute later Sam McMahon's shot shaved the post after the ball was worked across from the right. Darren Hay then put the ball in the net on 34 minutes but the offside flag had already been raised.</p>
  <p>King's Lynn goalkeeper Steve Wilson was almost caught out with two bad clearances in the 36th minute and on 41 minutes a volley from Lamey rolled just wide of the post.</p>
  <p>The game's defining moment arrived in the 43rd minute when a superb right-wing cross from Cowley was handled by Stephen Harvey above his head with Moore lurking behind him and the referee had no option but to send off Harvey and reduce the visitors to ten-men. LAMEY stepped up to crack home the resulting 44th minute penalty down the centre of goal with Wilson only helping the fierce shot into the net.</p>
  <p>Two minutes into the second half Forsdick weaved through the Linnets defence but his final chip fell just over the bar and a half-volley from Lamey on 49 minutes fell just past the post.</p>
  <p>Home goalkeeper Chris Taylor collected from Bloomfield on the left after 55 minutes and then picked up Jack Defty's header from a 57th minute Mark Angel corner. Moore broke clear a minute later at the other end but shot straight at Wilson.</p>
  <p>The Linnets created their best chance in the 64th minute after a neat interchange in the penalty area let in Bloomfield but Taylor did well to block. Bloomfield then headed high a minute later.</p>
  <p>Lamey suffered an injury on the hour and was replaced by Jimmy Haarhoff and the striker caused the visiting defence some late trouble with his darting runs. However, Haarhoff's finishing was wayward and in the 69th minute he fired weakly wide. After a couple of corners in the 76th minute in which Haarhoff appeared to be elbowed, Moore turned the ball across the face of goal for a third corner.</p>
  <p>With five minutes remaining Haarhoff robbed Hammond but blazed over the bar when free on goal with Wilson racing off his line. In injury time Angel's 20-yard shot flew over the bar but Halesowen easily held on to celebrate a deserved and vital three points.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2005/04/05/AWAY%20GOAL.html">AWAY GOAL</a></h2>
    <h3>WSC Final 1L  Studley 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz managed to draw 1-1 against the even mightier Studley in the first leg of the Worcester Senior Cup last night. They took the lead in the first half but we equalised through Nick Smith in the second to set up a surprisingly close second leg in a couple of weeks.</p>
  <p>The bad news of the night is The Pope was carried off with concussion after being caught by Taylor and spent the night in hospital. Not good news with some massive promotion games coming up.</p>
  <p>The first of those is at The Grove on Saturday when we host King's Lynn. They're only two points behind us with a game in hand so it's crucial we beat them if we can. It's going to be exciting to say the least!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Studley: Johnson; Dawe (Grubb 77), Dyer, Whittington, Walsh, Blake, Cross, Savery, Jones, Styles,  Neath (Fergie 85). Unused Subs: Strain, Ratray, Sanders</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Forsdick, Preston, Pope (Baker 8), Amos, Cowley, Haarhoff (Spencer 81), Lamey (Moore 68), Smith, Skidmore. Unused Sub: Bowater</p>
  <p>Referee: J. Cox (Evesham) Attendance: 295 Booked: Forsdick (29), Jones (30), Johnson (89).</p>
  <p>The first leg of the Worcestershire Senior Cup final finished all-square at the Beehive.</p>
  <p>But the hard-working Studley strugglers from the Travel Factory Alliance had the better of the evening with striker Kevin Jones in particular catching the eye against lack-lustre Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Goalkeeper Chris Taylor bludgeoned out of goal with fists flying in the 8th minute but only managed to knock his own player Steve Pope unconscious. The Halesowen captain was therefore forced to leave the field early for the second successive game, this time on a stretcher to be detained overnight in hospital with concussion.</p>
  <p>Taylor was then penalised for pushing from a 25th minute right wing corner and Anthony SAVERY despatched the resulting penalty to give Studley the lead in their first season in the Worcestershire Senior Cup.  The lively Jones broke free on 39 minutes but looped his effort over the Halesowen bar in an otherwise unappetising first half.</p>
  <p>After the lethargic start from the visitors, Nicki Preston headed a deep Alex Cowley cross over the bar on 41 minutes and Simon Forsdick blasted high in Halesowen's first attempts of the evening after winning a couple of corners.</p>
  <p>But with the Bees buzzing, Savery nodded inches wide from a free-kick on the edge of the area with Taylor beaten in the final minute of the first half. Seconds later Savery then skipped down the right wing after producing a clever flick but Adam Blake headed high with Taylor troubled again.</p>
  <p>Nick SMITH rifled home Halesowen's equaliser on 54 minutes with a left foot shot from the edge of the area to beat home goalkeeper Craig Johnson from Cowley's right-wing cross. On the hour a tricky run from midfield by Jones gave Savery another Studley opening but Taylor beat away his 20-yard shot. Jones then burst free again five minutes later but Taylor blocked with his legs and Preston cleared off the line as Scott Walsh followed up from the rebound.</p>
  <p>On the hour a tricky run from midfield by Jones gave Savery another Studley opening but Taylor beat away his 20-yard shot. Jones then burst free again five minutes later but Taylor blocked with his legs and Preston cleared off the line as Scott Walsh followed up from the rebound.</p>
  <p>Forsdick's left wing shot fell inches wide in the 71st minute but the game drifted towards a draw following a series of substitutes to set up an evenly poised second leg at the Grove on April 19th.</p>
  <p>In the final minute Studley goalkeeper Johnson was penalised for handling marginally outside of his area but then did just enough to keep out Cowley's resulting free-kick.</p>
  <p>With Ian Cooper suspended for the next three games and Pope doubtful following his injury, Halesowen look like entering the vital league game with Kings Lynn with a further depleted squad.</p>

    <h3>Chippenham 2 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz lost on Saturday against league leaders Chippenham, but with other results going somewhat our way we're still right in the middle of the most  ridiculously close contest for the play-offs .</p>
  <p>By all accounts we were unlucky not to get something out of the Chippenham game - see  Dave's match report  - but that leaves us with 4 critical games that we can win. The hardest looks like the King's Lynn game on Saturday, as they are one of probably 11 teams still in with a chance of promotion.</p>
  <p>Before that we have the distraction of the Worcester Senior Cup Final First Leg at Studley on Tuesday.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Johnson (Smith), Haywood, Preston, Pope (Skidmore), Amos, Cowley, Moore (Haarhoff), Lamey, Cooper, Forsdick. Unused Sub: Baker</p>
  <p>Attendance: 748</p>
  <p>Halesowen were unfortunate not to share the points and lost out by the odd goal in three as league leaders Chippenham were awarded a penalty and then notched a late winner.</p>
  <p>But play-off hopes were yet again preserved as all four teams occupying the play-off positions were beaten as one of the most even end-of-season scrambles for years continues to unfold in unpredictable fashion.</p>
  <p>Halesowen came under early pressure with both James Constable and Ben Kirk going close. The visitors then suffered a massive blow on 13 minutes when captain Steve Pope hobbled off with a calf injury, to be replaced by Stuart Skidmore. After regrouping, Alex Cowley was denied by Ian Herring and Simon Forsdick's 32nd minute effort was disallowed for offside. Chris Taylor saved from Chippenham's Constable by tipping the ball away on 36 minutes in the best chance of a generally lack-lustre first half following Scott Walker's free-kick.</p>
  <p>A minute after the interval Dave Gilroy took advantage of a poor back-pass from Skidmore but Taylor was on hand to save and on 55 minutes McEntegart denied Nathan Lamey as he was about to shoot at the other end. Chippenham took the lead in the 68th minute when Dave Haywood was penalised for handball amidst strong Halesowen protests and HERRING converted the spot-kick despite Taylor getting a hand on the ball.</p>
  <p>Halesowen levelled in the 84th minute when Gary Thorne fouled substitute Jimmy Haarhoff on the edge of the penalty area and LAMEY's shot took a deflection to beat home goalkeeper Mark Hervin. However, the Yeltz failed to hold on to a vital point when Nicki Preston impeded Constable in the 87th minute and with the referee waving play on, GILROY collected the ball and expertly lobbed the ball home over goalkeeper Taylor.</p>

    <h3>Merthyr 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Not only did we score, but the indomitable Yeltz pulled off a crucial victory with a 2-1 defeat of fellow play-off contenders Merthyr.</p>
  <p>In what sounds like an eventful match, we took the lead through a pen from The Pope, they equalised from another penalty, had a man sent off then newish bloke Nick Smith scored a late winner against the ten men. With rumours of the linesman giving the finger to the Yeltz fans - what more does a match need?</p>
  <p>The victory has moved us back into  6th place  and right back in the thick of things. On Saturday we travel to Chips and Ham in what looks like the hardest game of the five left - although they've lost their last two and are definitely wobbling. I don't think we've ever lost at their place, so more of the same would go down very well.</p>
  <p>Believe!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Merthyr Tydfil: Morris; Jones, York (Williams 87), Griffiths, Holloway, Carter, Bale, Clarke, French (Owen 87), Steins, Keddle. Unused Subs: Whitcombe, Howells</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Johnson (Skidmore 85), Haywood (Smith 74), Preston, Pope, Amos, Cowley, Haarhoff (Moore 78), Lamey, Cooper, Forsdick</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Knapp (Bristol)         Attendance: 410&#xD;
Booked: Carter (33), Holloway (33), Haywood (35), Preston (63), Steins (70), Johnson (81), Keddle (90). Sent Off: Carter (64).</p>
  <p>Halesowen returned to winning ways with a confidence-boosting victory at fellow play-off hopefuls Merthyr.</p>
  <p>However, the football was sometimes overshadowed as young referee Simon Knapp struggled to maintain control with a series of controversial decisions and seven bookings.</p>
  <p>Halesowen maintained a period of early pressure against the lack lustre hosts with Nathan Lamey flashing a shot just wide from 20 yards after just 15 seconds and Nicki Preston's free header from Alex Cowley's 3rd minute corner was cleared off the line by Danny Carter. But with goalkeeper Ashley Morris still not being troubled Simon Forsdick then ballooned over the bar from 5 yards from Lamey's 9th minute cross after being set free by Jimmy Haarhoff and Steve Pope hit a 30-yard free-kick just over the bar on 15 minutes.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz finally made the breakthrough to end 483 minutes of goal-less agony in the 33rd minute when Steve POPE smashed home a penalty kick after Jon Holloway was penalised for climbing over Lamey. Haarhoff then threaded the ball through for Cowley to shoot weakly wide in the 43rd minute and on the stroke of half-time Lamey struck a good chance wide after being set up by Haarhoff on the break.</p>
  <p>Merthyr failed to trouble visiting goalkeeper Chris Taylor until being awarded another soft penalty in the 58th minute when Carter went down under pressure from Pope and HOLLOWAY converted from the penalty spot. Cowley's 59th minute shot then led to a confident penalty call, but only a corner was awarded and at the other end Craig Steins hit wide from 8 yards on the hour for Merthyr.</p>
  <p>Carter was harshly dismissed to reduce the Martyrs to ten men in his second bookable offence on 64 minutes for muscling Forsdick off the ball in his superb run forward from defence. Halesowen seemed unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage with the game interrupted by a series of fouls and Chris Bale's 74th minute shot was deflected just wide.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz grabbed the vital winner on 84 minutes when substitute Nick SMITH finished well past Morris down the centre from 15 yards after a clever one-two with Lamey to shake-up the increasingly unpredictable play-off situation once again.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Gloucester 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>I heard a few people making the old joke that we should be renamed Halesowen Nil on Saturday, as we went an unbelievable 5th game without scoring in losing 2-0 at The Grove to Gloucester.</p>
  <p>We actually played pretty well considering we played most of the game with 10 men. Cooper got sent off for a stupid foul, when it looked like he tried to stamp on one of their defenders. It looked the correct decision from where I was standing, and a really daft thing to do.</p>
  <p>We held them for a tedious first half, and then in the second really took the game to them just missing on a few occasions. However when the otherwise excellent Haywood gave the ball away in his own half they took their chance well and it was really all over. As we tired they got a second, and we'd slipped right out of the play-off postions into  7th place .</p>
  <p>We've got six games left to turn things around, with the two most difficult ones coming up first. Today (Easter Monday) we visit Merthyr in a critical game we now probably can't afford to lose, then on Saturday we visit faltering league leaders Chips and Ham. We CAN still get into the play-offs, but we probably need at least 4 wins and a draw from our remaining matches.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper Haywood, Preston, Pope, Amos, Cowley, Haarhoff (Baker 16), Lamey, Skidmore, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Bowater, Moore, Johnson, Gayle.</p>
  <p>Gloucester City: Bath; C. Thompson, M. Thompson (Harris 54), Griffiths (Varnham 80), Tomkins, Burns, Mustoe, Smith, Addis, Webb (Knight 73), Wilkinson. Unused Sub: Reid.</p>
  <p>Referee: L. Hodgson (Nuneaton)     Attendance: 412  Booked: Webb (54), Cowley (60)     Sent Off: Cooper (9) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Nick Amos</p>
  <p>Halesowen's plunged out of the play-off places towards mid-table with another dismal home defeat as their longest spell of football without a goal for 25 years continued.</p>
  <p>Alex Cowley's deep 8th minute cross was cleared after being headed back across goal by Nick Amos. But Halesowen then gave themselves an almost impossible task after being forced to play most of the match with only 10 men. Referee Hodgson used his discretion to immediately brandish the red-card at Ian Cooper after only 9 minutes for allegedly stamping on Gloucester player-manager Chris Burns, despite some debate about the severity of the infringement.</p>
  <p>The incident changed the shape of the game and led to a drab first period with Halesowen sacrificing striker Jimmy Haarhoff for the midfield presence of substitute Lewis Baker in a tactical substitution on 16 minutes.</p>
  <p>Cowley skipped past Burns on the right but Lynson Tomkins cleared the resulting cross before the Tigers forced two corners from Neil Mustoe mid-way through the first half. On 37 minutes Amos headed on the ball for Baker but his overhead kick was tipped away for a corner by goalkeeper Matt Bath. Cowley's ambitious 41st minute run forward from midfield was then ended by Neil Griffiths and seconds before the break Steve Pope hit a 35-yard free-kick well wide.</p>
  <p>Ten-man Halesowen made a positive start to the second half with Tom Webb forced to clear Dave Haywood's corner off the line in the 46th minute. A minute later Simon Forsdick hit a 20-yard drive inches over the bar and on 48 minutes Nathan Lamey shot straight at the legs of Bath when clear on goal.</p>
  <p>On 51 minutes, Gloucester's Daryll Addis was let through by Haywood but Lee Smith placed his shot wide from a good position. The Yeltz went close again on 56 minutes when Baker could only poke the ball over the bar from just 5 yards from Cowley's cross and a 74th minute strike from Forsdick was parried away by Bath with Tomkins clearing for a corner.</p>
  <p>Gloucester hit two late goals with Halesowen finally running out of steam to slump to their fourth straight defeat. A slip from Haywood allowed Lee SMITH to beat goalkeeper Chris Taylor from the edge of the area in the 77th minute and with four minutes remaining ADDIS squeezed home a low angled drive from the right.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Rugby 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's been a very disappointing week, with three losses, no goals scored and our place in the playoffs looking a lot less secure. On Saturday we failed to score for the fourth game running and with Rugby getting one in the second half we're now down in  4th place . It's ridiculously close again, with 12th placed Chesham only 5 points behind us with a game in hand, so it's all down to form in the last seven or so games. Hmmm.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we host our friends from Gloucester in a game that kicks off early (12.30pm) because of the England game, before a difficult visit on Easter Monday to Merthyr (that's a 3.00pm according to the Southern League website).</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Johnson, Haywood, Preston (Amos 85), Pope, Skidmore (Smith 75), Cowley, Moore (Haarhoff 68), Lamey, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Sub: Cooper.</p>
  <p>Rugby United: Beckwith; Moran, Williams, Hart, Herbert, Redgate (Matthews 65), Hall, Dutton, Beard (Douglas 73), Marsden, Squire. Unused Subs: Evans, Shepherd.</p>

  <p>The second home defeat of the week left Halesowen clinging onto a play-off position by a single point.</p>
  <p>A disastrous run of three straight defeats and a goal-drought extending to four games has threatened to spoil a successful season and Halesowen again failed to create anything meaningful in a desperately disappointing first half.</p>
  <p>Steve Pope managed the faintest of headers to clear a Jamie Williams cross in the 10th minute with Justin Marsden ready to pounce and two minutes later Danny Hall hit over the bar in a crowded goalmouth as Rugby made a confident start.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen struggling to recapture their early season form, visiting goalkeeper Robert Beckwith dropped the ball from Alex Cowley's long throw-in after 17 minutes but recovered to dive on the ball with no Halesowen forward able to take advantage. Lewis Baker and Nathan Lamey then struck half chances wide on 26 minutes and Dave Haywood delivered Halesowen's first corner on 38 minutes but Baker flashed a header across goal.</p>
  <p>Rugby finished the first half strongly and created the best chance of the opening period in the 42nd minute when Rory Squire met a right-wing freekick only to see his header rebound off the crossbar. Three minutes later Marsden was then put clear on goal after Karl Johnson lost the ball in midfield but Nicki Preston and Steve Pope defended well to clear the danger.</p>
  <p>Chris Taylor collected a 46th minute effort from Craig Dutton from a free-kick before a back-header from Baker crept inches wide at the other end. With the visitors still engineering the better opportunities, Robbie Beard turned well on his return to the Rugby forward-line after a long-term injury but his 54th minute shot from 20 yards drifted just wide and a minute later strike partner Marsden struck the side-netting. On the hour Haywood found Simon Forsdick in the Rugby area but the ball was cleared for a corner as he clipped a shot towards goal.</p>
  <p>Jamie WILLIAMS lashed home Rugby's decisive 67th minute goal from the edge of the area off the underside of the crossbar after a cross was only partly cleared to alleviate any lingering relegation worries for the visitors.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz livening up late on but still struggled to find a breakthrough despite their urgency. Cowley's 74th minute shot was deflected wide after good work from Forsdick and on 77 minutes a clever Forsdick dummy allowed Haywood to hammer just wide from 25 yards. However, Rugby defended solidly with Pope smashing an 80th minute direct free-kick wide of the mark and on 88 minutes Beckwith saved from Lamey and substitute Jimmy Haarhoff from another long throw-in from Cowley. In the final minute Rugby substitute Dave Pearson's shot flew just over the bar.</p>
  <p>Manager Paul Holleran remained in the dressing room with his Halesowen players well after the final whistle in a heart-to-heart session before the vital Easter programme.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Histon 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>I don't think there's any chance we can win automatic promotion now after a disappointing 2-0 loss to Histon at The Grove last night. Despite having a reasonable amount of the play, we didn't score for the third match running and had no answer when they scored two in the second-half.</p>
  <p>However, let's not get too down-hearted. We are still in an excellent position for clinching a play-off place (which is probably what we deserve on performances so far), as long as we press on in our remaining games. We start with a home game against a struggling Rugby which I'd hope we can get 3 points from. We can do it!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Amos, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Skidmore, Cowley, Haarhoff (Moore 80), Lamey, Baker (Smith 80), Forsdick. Unused Subs: Cooper, Bowater, Johnson</p>
  <p>Histon: Key; Joseph, Okay, Hipperson, Vowden, A. Cambridge, Bridges, Andrews, Kennedy, I. Cambridge, Barker. Unused Subs: Knight-Percival, Gutzmore, Farrington, Webster, Hulyer.</p>
  <p>Referee: J. Holbrook (Kidderminster)  Attendance: 384</p>
  <p>Booked: I. Cambridge (56), Cowley (71) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Steve Pope</p>
  <p>Halesowen's play-off hopes took a massive dive with a disappointing defeat in a game that failed to live up to expectations as title favourites Histon moved up to second place in the table.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz made an eager start but were forced to clear a 13th minute corner and a 14th minute free-kick as the visitors packed the 6-yard box.</p>
  <p>Alex Cowley intercepted play in midfield in the 16th minute but goalkeeper Lance Key beat Nathan Lamey to his through ball and ten minutes later Jimmy Haarhoff almost latched onto a back-header from Lewis Baker. Home goalkeeper Chris Taylor lost the ball in the 31st minute but recovered to make a reflex save to deny Colin Vowden and on 34 minutes Ian Cambridge hit a 20-yard free-kick over the bar after Neil Andrews was brought down.</p>
  <p>Dave Haywood hit a speculative 35-yard effort over the bar in the 38th minute after winning the ball well in midfield but Baker then missed the best chance of the half by heading a loose ball wide of an open goal in the 41st minute. A minute later Nicki Preston planted a firm header wide from Cowley's free-kick after Lamey was fouled.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz dominated the start of the second half against the disappointing visitors who looked content with a draw and in the 52nd minute Key lost control of the ball when clearing but Simon Forsdick shot wide with the goalkeeper out of his area. Cowley then embarked on a weaving run to set Lamey free but Key saved. On the hour Key then saved from Lamey near his right-hand post with Baker hitting over the bar in a good spell of pressure.</p>
  <p>After barely threatening the Halesowen goal all evening, Histon snatched a 63rd minute lead when a long throw in was only partly cleared and Taylor dropped the ball for Jamie BARKER to hammer home into the roof of the net from close range.</p>
  <p>As Halesowen ran out of ideas, Neil Kennedy shot wide before Neil ANDREWS made it 2-0 in the 75th minute with an easy follow-up into an empty net after Barker's shot was deflected.</p>
  <p>In the final minute Halesowen substitute Jason Moore shot meekly past the post when clear with demoralised Halesowen failing to score for the third consecutive game.</p>

    <h3>Tiverton 1 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In a disappointing result, the indomitable Yeltz failed to take advantage of other teams dropping points when we lost 1-0 down at Tiverton. By all accounts it was a difficult pitch, but we didn't play well and didn't deserve anything out of the game. Still, with only Aylesbury winning in the top 8 we remain in  3rd place in the table .</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we have a massive match at The Grove when Histon are the visitors. They have plenty of games in hand and look on paper to be the only realistic challengers to Chips and Ham, but it's been a strange season so far and Histon losing at home to Gloucester was quite a shock. We just HAVE to win if we are going to win the league, but we gave them a decent game at their place earlier in the season, and I'm confident we can do it!</p>
  <p>I'm sure you know already by now, but make sure you note that the last away game of the season is now on April 23rd at Hitchin, as it's been confirmed that it and the Team Barth games on the last two weekends have been switched.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Tiverton Town: Ovendale; Winter, Binnicombe, Walker, Rudge, Cousins, Wills, Harvey, Yetton, Boothe, Mudge. Subs: Nogan, Goff, Densham, Milsom, Hambly</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Amos, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Skidmore, Cowley, Haarhoff, Lamey, Smith, Forsdick. Subs: Moore, Baker, Cooper, Johnson</p>
  <p>Attendance: 519</p>
  <p>Halesowen failed to capitalise on a series of slip-ups by their play-off rivals and were deservedly beaten by a solitary goal at mid-table Tiverton in a poor game.</p>
  <p>Out of sorts Halesowen only managed three real attempts on goal afternoon and barely troubled home goalkeeper Ovendale on a heavily sanded surface.</p>
  <p>The hosts almost took a 2nd minute lead through Iain Harvey at the far post and in the 11th minute Stewart Yetton went close from Steve Winter's free-kick. Chris Taylor then made an excellent 33rd minute reflex save from Winter's shot.</p>
  <p>Tivvy grabbed the winning goal a minute before half-time when Nicki Preston missed a header from Ovendale's long clearance from goal leaving leading scorer Jamie MUDGE in plenty of space to score his 28th goal of the season.</p>
  <p>Mudge proved a constant danger and was given too much time again on the hour as he flashed a low shot just wide of the post and then went close again three minutes later.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to struggle in the second half and made little impact up-front despite a double substitution in the 62nd minute.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Bath 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Despite having most of the play, the indomitable Yeltz for once failed to score and had to settle for a 0-0 draw at The Grove against Bath. No match report from DJ this week I'm afraid, so if any one would like to fill in for him, please feel free (use the link below).</p>
  <p>In other results, Bedford only drew, Chips and Ham and Histon were called off, Merthyr won but Aylesbury lost which means we're still looking good for the play-offs but it's looking a bit more unlikely we can challenge for the title. Still there are 10 games to go so it's far from over.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we make the long trip down to  <a href="http://www.tiverton-town-fc.co.uk/">Tiverton</a>  in the league. They're having a patchy season but still have hopes of making the play-offs. We beat them 3-1 earlier in the season, and a repeat of that result would go down very well.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Bedford 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In another crucial game in our promotion challenge, the indomitable Yeltz gained an important three points when a late Lamey goal beat 2nd placed Bedford 2-1 ay The Grove. Full details of an exciting game in  DJ's match report .</p>
  <p>With most of the other top teams winning, the  top six  are now starting to open up a bit of a gap, but I'd hesitate to say it's only between those teams the way this season's gone. Still we're in an excellent position for the play-offs and have good chances to challenge Chips and Ham for the title if we can continue our current good run. Come on!!!</p>
  <p>Our next game is on Saturday we host Bath City at The Grove. They're on a poor run at the moment with only one win in seven, but they've always been tough opponents for us so it's not going to be easy. Of our eleven games left we have three aginst promotion challengers (Histon, Merthyr and Chippenham) but it's critical we pick up as many wins in the other games as possible. We can still win this league!</p>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Jones, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Skidmore (Smith 89), Cowley, Haarhoff (Moore 77), Lamey, Baker (Amos 49), Forsdick. Unused Sub: Cooper</p>
  <p>Bedford Town: Robinson; Jackman, Okai, Rydeheard, Howarth, James, Challinor, Stupple, Dillon, Howe, Lawley. Unused Subs: McElroy, Blake, Grieve.</p>
  <p>Referee: G. Horwood (Luton)  Attendance: 573&#xD;
Booked: Skidmore (31), Lawley (36)&#xD;
Sponsors' Man of the Match: Simon Forsdick and Nathan Lamey (joint)</p>
  <p>A sensational last minute winner from two-goal Nathan Lamey sealed a splendid victory over second placed Bedford and boosted Halesowen's hopes of securing a play-off position.</p>
  <p>Halesowen tore into the Eagles from the start and went ahead after just four minutes when Lewis Baker helped on a left-wing cross for LAMEY to control the ball and slam an excellent half-volley past goalkeeper James Robinson from 8 yards after Craig Rydeheard failed to clear.</p>
  <p>Robinson was able to save Alex Cowley's 20-yard shot two minutes later and on 14 minutes Lamey almost met a deep Dave Haywood cross at the far post. With Halesowen looking sharp up-front, Cowley then surged into the Bedford area in the 25th minute and appeared to be tripped, although play was waved on.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to totally dominate the first half winning nine corners with Bedford failing to record a shot up to the interval. Jimmy Haarhoff was set free but his cross ran along the face of goal in the 35th minute after a smart break from Haywood and two minutes later Robinson made an instinctive one-handed reflex save from Baker's 10-yard goal-bound shot.</p>
  <p>Bedford finally won their first corner in the 47th minute after Derwayne Stupple shot just wide and three minutes later home goalkeeper Chris Taylor collected a cross from Parys Okai.</p>
  <p>On the hour Haywood made another dangerous run forward at the Bedford defence, but could not quite find Lamey and four minutes later Haywood's free-kick found Haarhoff, but Robinson collected his 10-yard shot low down.</p>
  <p>The Eagles landed a shock equaliser through Lee HOWARTH from the penalty spot in the 71st minute when Nicki Preston was harshly penalised as Rene Howe fell to the floor in a messy penalty area scramble. A minute later Howe sliced a good chance wide on the break before battling Bedford won two 75th minute corners.</p>
  <p>Cowley was blocked in the area in the 78th minute with Robinson then saving from Lamey and on 81 minutes Rydeheard squirted a shot past the post at the other end.</p>
  <p>In the final minute Steve Pope's fierce 30 yard free-kick was deflected wide. But Halesowen grabbed the victory their first half performance deserved when Cowley's corner was headed on by substitute Nick Amos for LAMEY to hold off his defender and hit a spectacular overhead kick into the net in front of the joyous Shed.</p>

    <h3>WSC SF  Redditch 0 Yeltz 5</h3>

    <p>
  <p>5-0 - never expected that! In an excellent performance against a pretty much full strength Redditch team, we won very easily to go through to the Worcester Senior Cup Final against Studley. Full details in  Dave's match report , but I'd just like to mention how pleasing it is to see Jason back scoring again, especially as he's looked pretty sharp whenever I've seen him recently.</p>
  <p>In other league games, Chips and Ham only drew, Aylesbury lost and Histon were leading Bedford 2-0 in the 86th minute when the floodlights failed and the match was called off.</p>
  <p>And so to Saturday, when second-placed Bedford visit The Grove in a crucial game for our promotion hopes. I think we can still win the league if we can win maybe 9 or 10 of our remaining games, but with all the top teams still to play we obviously need to beat them. Let's hope for 3 points on Saturday to really be back in the hunt for the title.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Redditch United: Anstiss; Scheppel, Charlton, M. Taylor, Knight, Flynn, Hollis, McHugh, Sylla, Rickards, Grey (Softley HT). Unused Subs: Manton, Harkness.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: C. Taylor; Jones, Haywood, Preston, Pope (Amos 68), Skidmore, Cowley (Moore 75), Haarhoff, Lamey, Baker (Smith 71), Forsdick</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Scarr (Rubery)</p>
  <p>Halesowen thrashed high-flying Redditch from the Conference North at the Valley Stadium to reach the final of the Worcestershire Senior Cup for the second time in three years.</p>
  <p>With the home side fielding five former Halesowen players, Chris Taylor saved from Scott Rickards in the 2nd minute and Mark Taylor drove just wide from 25 yards for Redditch in the 13th minute.</p>
  <p>Halesowen then took control of the game with Dave Haywood hitting a couple of free-kicks at goalkeeper Richard Anstiss before Nathan Lamey glanced wide with a header from a good position from another Haywood cross in the 20th minute. Halesowen won the first corner of the game a minute later and from a weak Anstiss clearance Alex Cowley fed Jimmy Haarhoff but the nippy striker blasted high and wide. On 29 minutes an acrobatic overhead kick from Rickards flew over the bar for the Reds.</p>
  <p>The visitors took the lead in the 31st minute when Gary Knight and Danny Scheppel bundled Haarhoff off the ball in the area and Steve POPE hit the resulting penalty into the left side of the net for his 18th goal of the season. Cowley skipped down the right wing in the 35th minute but Haarhoff's shot was blocked from the cross and Lamey then fed Haarhoff in the 42nd minute but Anstiss raced off his line to clear the danger.</p>
  <p>Hard-working LAMEY was rewarded for his persistence on the stroke of half-time when he side-stepped two defenders and his 20-yard shot was deflected into the corner of the net to put Halesowen in the driving seat.</p>
  <p>The snow came down at the start of a second-half that saw no improvement from Redditch, although Chris Taylor collected from Hollis in the 56th minute and highly rated Norman Sylla put an overhead kick over the bar on the hour. In a comical moment, the referee requested a replacement to the white ball tom help in the snowy conditions, only to find the new red-ball replacement was completely camouflaged by the Redditch strip before reverting back to the original white.</p>
  <p>Halesowen pressed home their advantage with a third goal in the 65th minute when Simon Forsdick set Haarhoff free down the right and his cross was met by LAMEY's fine glancing header. With the Redditch defence in tatters, HAARHOFF beat Hollis on the edge of the area before firing into the bottom corner to make it 4-0 in the 68th minute.</p>
  <p>Chris Taylor dropped a cross from Asa Charlton in the 73rd minute, but Redditch's evening was summed up when substitute Richard Softley could only hit the rebound onto the top of the bar.</p>
  <p>Substitute Jason MOORE completed their five-star performance in the 76th minute when he turned his marker before slipping the ball past Anstiss from Haarhoff's cross.</p>
  <p>Halesowen now go forward to meet Studley from the Travel Factory Alliance in the Final.</p>

    <h3>Stamford 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Everyone else had won at Stamford recently, so it was an important three points gained on Saturday when the indomitable Yeltz came back from behind to win 2-1 on a bitterly cold day.</p>
  <p>They scored first early on with the wind helping, but we equalised soon after after their keeper failed to clear a cross and The Pope poked it in. They were pretty poor to be honest, but the cold weather and muddy pitch levelled things up for quite a while. We had a few chances, but once we'd took the lead after a decent move led to my man of the match Dave Haywood firing in a low cross-shot that the defender deflected in, we looked comfortable in holding the lead.</p>
  <p>Most of the top teams also won, so we're still solidly in  third place  in the table.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday is a crucial home game against second placed Bedford, but before that is the Worcester Senior SemiFinal at Redditch. With both teams battling for promotion it definitely not the highest priority for either of us, but with only Studley awaiting in the final it would be nice to gain our usual victory over them!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Jones, Haywood, Preston, Pope (c), Skidmore, Cowley (Smith 82), Haarhoff (Moore 80), Lamey, Amos (Baker 55), Forsdick. Unused Sub: Cooper</p>
  <p>Attendance: 290                    Referee: Mike Cairns (Northampton)</p>
  <p>Halesowen professionally overcame basement side Stamford with an assured performance to keep well in touch with top spot and five points into a play-off position.</p>
  <p>However, the afternoon started badly for the Yeltz as they fell behind in just the 4th minute when Kevin SLINN chased a long ball and held off central defenders Steve Pope and Nicki Preston before beating Chris Taylor. But before Stamford could settle into their stride, Halesowen levelled when good work from Nathan Lamey led to a corner-kick from Dave Haywood and leading goalscorer Pope converted the loose ball on the half volley.</p>
  <p>From that point on Stamford rarely threatened although a Danny Steadman header crept just wide of the post in the 36th minute. A minute later a great shot by Lamey was turned over the bar by Stamford goalkeeper Darren Watts.</p>
  <p>The second half belonged firmly to Halesowen in an impressive display of attacking football, and it was surprising they only had the one goal to show for their efforts. Lamey twice went close to notching the goal he richly deserved, and Pope sent a trademark free kick just wide of the post on the hour. Man of the match Lamey eventually provided the winner on 65 minutes, when he cleverly directed the ball over his head into the path of Haywood and his shot struck Delroy GORDON before hitting the back of the net. Two minutes later, an Alex Cowley shot hit the bar and in the dying minutes substitute Nick Smith went close when he beat the defence but shot at the keeper.</p>

    <p>
  <p>In the match that REALLY mattered, the indomitable Yeltz put on a fine display to beat Solihull 4-0 and avenge their defeat earlier in the season. Goals from Jimmy, Alex, Fozzy and Lamey kept us in  3rd place  in the table.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday we travel to Stamford in another important game. They are really struggling at the moment, so we need to get three points if we are going to keep in with a chance of the title.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: C. Taylor; Jones, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Skidmore, Cowley, Haarhoff (Moore 69), Lamey (Danks 79), Amos, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Baker, Cooper</p>

  <p>Referee: C. Banks (Bicester)  Attendance: 401 Booked: Peer (20), Preston (31), Skidmore (80) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Nick Amos</p>
  <p>Halesowen made Paul Holleran a happy manager by earning a convincing victory against his former club Solihull to erase the memory of the New Years Day defeat.</p>
  <p>But it was an unhappy return to the Grove for former Halesowen goalkeeper Mark Sheils who came under early siege before being carried off after a nasty second half injury.</p>
  <p>Nick Amos battled away in midfield on the heavy pitch and was rewarded by being named as Halesowen's Man of the Match by sponsors West Midlands Fasteners Ltd.</p>
  <p>In a determined start, Simon Forsdick cut in from the left in the 6th minute but Sheils pushed the ball away into safety. Halesowen then took a 9th minute lead when Nathan Lamey drew the defence down the left and brought a fine one-handed save from Sheils. Skidmore hit the rebound towards goal and Sheils recovered to make a double save but could not stop Jimmy HAARHOFF converting his first goal since October with his 10th of the season from 10 yards out.</p>
  <p>With the Yeltz in control, Sheils came under continued pressure and made a super reflex save near the post from Forsdick who cleverly flicked past Steve Farmer before beating a further two defenders. Shell-shocked Sheils then saved a free header from Steve Pope low down from the resulting corner in a muddy penalty area.</p>
  <p>Halesowen increased their lead in the 18th minute when Lamey beat the last defender and Sheils could only parry his shot away for Alex COWLEY to follow up and score into an empty net from 6 yards.</p>
  <p>Home goalkeeper Chris Taylor had a quiet afternoon but was called on to save Solihull's first shot in the 21st minute from Morton Titterton. Haarhoff and Lamey combined well on the half-hour, with Haarhoff just failing to find the final touch before the visitors enjoyed a better spell and forced two 33rd minute corners. Two minutes before the interval Lamey drove forward and unleashed a 25 yard shot that was deflected away for a corner.</p>
  <p>The strong wind continued to make playing conditions difficult in the second half and play became scrappy for a period after Pope hit a direct 47th minute free-kick inches over the bar.</p>
  <p>FORSDICK made the points safe with a spectacular solo strike in the 60th minute when he surged forward from midfield and buried the ball into the top corner of the net from 20 yards in a clinical finish. Sheils was in the wars in the 66th minute in a collision with Halesowen's Dave Haywood and had to be taken off with a head injury.</p>
  <p>Halesowen cruised into a 4-0 lead in the 68th minute when Haarhoff laid the ball back for Forsdick to drive the ball across the face of goal but LAMEY was on hand to hit the net from an acute angle to beat substitute goalkeeper Craig Johnson.</p>
  <p>In the dying minutes Solihull's Farmer headed a Rob Taylor free-kick wide and in injury time Cowley almost added a fifth Halesowen goal when he burst through the visiting defence but his effort was blocked in a one-on-one with goalkeeper Johnson.</p>

    <p>
  <p>I think I've been consistent over the years in saying I don't care about these "midweek" cups (League Cup and Senior Cups), but even I'm a bit disappointed in getting completely stuffed by Sutton Coldfield 4-0. Full details if you can bear it in  Dave's match report .</p>
  <p>We're back to more important matters on Saturday when Solihull come to The Grove in the League. After they beat us earlier in the season we really need to gain revenge and more importantly three points to keep our promotion challenge going.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Sutton Coldfield Town: Bray; K. Jones, Wilson, Spittle, Geohaghan, Watkins, Wolsey (Cole 85), Massingham, Arshad (Baker 28), Markman (Fuller 72), Berks. Unused Subs: Rowe, Ling</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: M. Jones; D. Jones, Forsdick, Preston, Pope, Skidmore, Cowley, Moore (Lamey HT), Danks (Haywood 67), Amos, Clarke (Haarhoff HT). Unused Subs: Baker, Taylor.</p>
  <p>Referee: J. Cox (Evesham)   Attendance: 115</p>
  <p>Damian Markman notched a hat-trick as Sutton took full advantage of a Halesowen nightmare that saw them register their worst ever defeat under manager Paul Holleran.</p>
  <p>On a mud-heap pitch, Sutton proved to be more committed and were first to the ball as they played the appalling conditions much better than higher league Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Steve Pope made an important challenge to deny Markman in the 5th minute and three minutes later a Sutton free-kick was cleared after novice on-loan Halesowen goalkeeper Matt Jones raced off his line to bring down Narveed Arshad just outside the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Marksman MARKMAN gave the Royals the lead in the 14th by easily slotting the ball under Matt Jones in a one-on-one when a long ball forward stuck in the ankle-deep mud. Two minutes later Markman crossed from the right and ARSHAD touched the ball onto the post with goalkeeper Matt Jones then fumbling the ball into the net for Sutton's second goal. On 23 minutes MARKMAN latched onto a long ball to hit past the uncomfortable Matt Jones on the half-volley to give Sutton an incredible 3-0 lead with their 11th goal in the last 55 minutes of League Cup football.</p>
  <p>Mark Wolsey struck wide twice before half-time with Halesowen then making a double substitution up front at the interval. But with no improvement from the Yeltz, Wolsey hit a 50th minute free-kick wide from the edge of the area and David Berks struck just wide on the hour with the hosts in complete control.</p>
  <p>MARKMAN completed his hat-trick in the 70th minute by heading home Wolsey's right-wing cross and three minutes later full-back Sam Wilson went close from the left of the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Nathan Lamey finally hit a token effort just wide for Halesowen in the 71st minute and Cowley hit Halesowen's only shot on-target at home goalkeeper Justin Bray in the 78th minute of a desperately disappointing performance from the visitors.</p>

    <h3>Rugby 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We've certainly picked up a few extra points with late goals this season, and we gained another valuable point when a late Alex Cowley goal gave us a 1-1 draw away to Rugby (I think it's safest just to call them that at the moment). We're still in  3rd place , but with Chips and Ham winning again we're starting to fall behind top spot a little.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we go to Sutton Coldfield in the last 16 of the League Cup, before hosting Solihull in the League next Saturday.</p>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Jones, Haywood (Amos 76), Preston, Pope, Skidmore, Cowley, Moore (Danks 76), Lamey, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Sub: Clarke</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Henry (Rothwell)   Attendance: 542</p>
  <p>Alex Cowley rescued Halesowen with an equaliser two minutes into injury time.</p>
  <p>Injury depleted Halesowen could only name three substitutes with on-loan 19-year old WBA midfielder Ross Clarke taking his place on bench with Jimmy Haarhoff taken ill in addition to long-term injuries to Ben Steane, Ian Cooper, Andy Spencer and Craig Strachan.</p>
  <p>The game was marked by protests against United's proposed name change to Rugby Town with home fans pledging their allegiance to the former VS Rugby name. In a low-key start, Rugby's Justin Marsden flashed just wide in the 4th minute and Halesowen's Dave Haywood hit an 8th minute free-kick too close to home goalkeeper Mike Payne. Full back Gary Moran then blazed a 17th minute volley high over the bar following a free-kick from fellow full-back Jamie Williams.</p>
  <p>Halesowen gained the upper hand mid-way through the first half with Cowley producing some tricky right-wing play to deliver a dangerous 21st minute cross, but Payne managed to punch clear. In the 23rd minute Steve Pope fed Simon Forsdick with Haywood's resulting volley blocked and Nathan Lamey's 20-yard shot was tipped over the bar for a corner by Payne a minute later.</p>
  <p>The best chance of the first-half fell to the Yeltz in the 31st minute when Nicki Preston met Haywood's free-kick but his header struck the crossbar and Lewis Baker hit the rebound over the bar.</p>
  <p>On 37 minutes a corner from Rugby's Williams was palmed away by visiting goalkeeper Chris Taylor with the following shot from Craig Dutton blocked and just before the interval Lamey almost met another fine Cowley cross at the far post. Dave Pearson stuck over Halesowen's bar at the start of the second half before Preston was denied again in the 53rd minute when Williams cleared off the line as Halesowen won two corners.</p>
  <p>With little to choose between the two teams and few chances created, Rugby looked set for their fourth consecutive 0-0 home draw until they snatched a 68th minute lead. Haywood cleared a Williams corner off the line but Danny Hall played the ball back into the penalty area and PEARSON's back header looped over the head of goalkeeper Taylor into the net.</p>
  <p>There remained little to choose between the teams with few further chances created although Halesowen's Pope had a good call for a penalty denied. Rugby substitute Jermaine Gordon almost increased the lead when he caught out Taylor by beating him to a long ball but the ball trickled past the post in the 89th minute.</p>
  <p>But Cowley retrieved a point for Halesowen when his last-gasp corner led to a goalmouth scramble and the ball broke back out on the left of the area for COWLEY to drill home a sweet 15-yard shot into the top corner.</p>

    <p>
  <p>The closeness of the league was confirmed last night when a 2-0 victory over Hemel Hempstead moved us back into the play off places in  3rd place . Goals from The Pope and Nathan in either half clinched the points.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately Ben Steane broke a tibia in the game, so looks like he could be out for some time. Ben had just recovered from a long term injury and was getting back into good form, so let's hope for a speedy recovery.</p>
  <p>Saturday takes us to Rugby to take our old rivals, who aren't in great form (but beat Aylesbury last week). It's a bit sad I guess, but I STILL feel upset about how they beat us in the Vase Final over 20 years ago now(!), so I really hope we can beat them to maintain our position near the top.</p>
  <p>Also a couple of fixtures have been confirmed: the League Cup game at Sutton is now on Tuesday 8th Feb, kick off 7.30, and Redditch in the Worcs Senior Cup Semi Final is away on Feb 22nd - winners meet the mighty Studley in the final!! (quote from DJ)</p>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Jones, Haywood, Preston, Pope, I. Cooper (Cowley 15), Steane (Skidmore 27), Haarhoff (Moore 80), Lamey, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Amos, Danks</p>
  <p>Hemel Hempstead: Peat; Neale, Fontonelle, Kelly, G. Cooper, Corbould, Beevor, Midson, Carney (Allen 83), Harding, Fowler (Hammatt 66). Unused Subs: Green, Theodosiou, Lovell</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Snartt (Bristol)  Attendance: 283 Booked: Preston (20), Fowler (45), Pope (57), Fontonelle (57), Carney (78) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Simon Forsdick</p>
  <p>Halesowen moved back into third place after overcoming hard-working Hemel Hempstead in a far from pretty encounter.</p>
  <p>A very ordinary first half was marred by two serious Halesowen injuries with the unlucky Ben Steane taken to a Coventry hospital with a confirmed broken tibia.</p>
  <p>Relegation threatened Hemel made a lively start pushing forward at a swift pace on their first ever visit to the Grove and goalkeeper Chris Taylor had to redeem himself by collecting a 15th minute corner after failing to collect the initial cross.</p>
  <p>Ian Cooper was stretchered off in the 15th minute with a twisted knee injury and on 25 minutes Steane's free-kick was collected by Hemel goalkeeper Martin Peat. Steane looked to be back to his creative best after earning a place in the starting line-up, but fate dealt a cruel 27th minute blow when he was also stretchered off to be back in plaster only weeks after recovering from a broken foot.</p>
  <p>The visitors continued to make life difficult for the Yeltz, who wasted two corners in the 32nd minute, and on 40 minutes Grant Carney glanced the top of the bar with a right-wing cross.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were presented with their much-needed breakthrough when George Fowler brought down Steve Pope in the penalty area in the fifth minute of first-half added time. Pope's penalty kick was blocked by Peat but captain POPE calmly controlled the rebound to fire home his 16th goal of the season. Jimmy Haarhoff then turned on the edge of the area but his shot flew just wide with the clock showing 52 minutes of the opening half.</p>
  <p>Pope flashed a header just over the bar from Dave Haywood's cross five minutes into the second period but two minutes later an up-and-under from Hemel's Jack Midson was volleyed just over the bar by Dean Harding. Stuart Beevor's 55th minute free-kick from 25-yards was then collected at the second attempt by Taylor in the Halesowen goal.</p>
  <p>Halesowen added a second goal on 56 minutes when Lewis Baker advanced from midfield and drew the visiting defence before seeing his shot parried away by Peat, but Nathan LAMEY was on hand to convert the rebound from six yards. Peat saved a good 59th minute strike from Forsdick after the ball broke from a corner and after Hemel won two corners on the hour, Lamey and Forsdick both went close with 65th minute headers from Alex Cowley's cross.</p>
  <p>Anthony Fontonelle missed a good chance to pull a goal back in the 75th minute but he hit just over the bar after being set free by Grant Carney. With two minutes remaining, Baker hooked the ball over the Hemel bar when Peat missed his punch and in another seven minutes of added time in the second half substitute Bryan Hammatt headed just wide for the visitors.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Stamford 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In the ridiculously tight battle at the top of the table, we missed another chance to move into the play-off positions when we failed to beat lowly Stamford. Full details in Dave's match report, but it seems like we had a lot of pressure without being able to get a winner.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we have another game against a lower team when Hemel Hempstead visit The Grove. If we win we will move right up to 3rd place, so it's even more important we get those 3 points.</p>

If you don't know what these are,  <a href="http://www.rss-specifications.com/">this site</a>  has a reasonable explanation; if you do hopefully you'll find them useful.

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Jones, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Cooper, Cowley (Steane 71), Haarhoff, Lamey (Moore 81), Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Danks, Amos</p>
  <p>Stamford AFC: Watts; Green, Peaks, Holyoak, Gordon, Steadman, Nash, Butterworth, Duffy, Slinn, Edge. Unused Subs: Thompson, Pritchard, Mintus, Ashby</p>
  <p>Referee: L. Hodgson (Nuneaton) Attendance: 443 Booked: None Sponsors' Man of the Match: Dave Haywood</p>
  <p>Halesowen could only manage a draw in a game that should have been wrapped up well before half-time with captain Steve Pope influential in both goals.</p>
  <p>Jimmy Haarhoff's 6th minute cross was nearly turned home by Simon Forsdick, but the ball squirted free. Pope then headed Dave Haywood's 12th minute corner just over the bar and two minutes later Haarhoff laid the ball off for Forsdick to blast a good chance high.</p>
  <p>Forsdick continued to pose a constant threat and on 18 minutes his fine 20-yard strike forced Stamford goalkeeper Darren Watts into an excellent save by turning the ball around the post for the first of two corners.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally went ahead in the 20th minute when POPE smashed home his 15th goal of the campaign from the penalty spot after Forsdick was put through and was chopped down when about to score.</p>
  <p>Ian Cooper almost increased the lead three minutes later but his 20-yard shot rebounded off the crossbar with Watts beaten.</p>
  <p>Despite being well on top, Halesowen failed to build on their lead and paid the price when Stamford equalised with their first shot on target in the 37th minute. Pope failed to clear a right-wing cross on the uneven surface and only managed to set up on-loan Rushden striker Robert DUFFY to gratefully slam home from 12 yards.</p>
  <p>Danny Steadman's 47th minute shot for the Daniels was deflected over the bar for a corner but otherwise the draw specialists of the league had little to offer in attack and packed their defence to hold onto their 14th draw of the season.</p>
  <p>Nicki Preston glanced a 48th minute header just wide from Dave Haywood's free-kick and Lewis Baker headed on Forsdick's cross four minutes later with Nathan Lamey's effort going wide of the post. Stamford then survived a goal-mouth scramble on the hour with Forsdick, Baker and Alex Cowley all having attempts on goal. Substitute Ben Steane was introduced in the final 20 minutes and took control in midfield with his impressive creative play and Watts produced a flying 76th minute save when Jimmy Haarhoff headed down Dave Haywood's cross in front of goal.</p>
  <p>But Halesowen could not find another breakthrough from the constant late pressure and in injury time Watts fell on the ball to save in a packed penalty area from Pope.</p>

    <h3>Team Bath 2 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The way our performances have gone recently, our unpredictability has become predictable, so it was no real surprise when we lost 2-0 down at Team Bath. Goals in each half means we're stuck in 7th place having blown our game in hand. By all accounts it was a pretty poor performance, but let's not forget we're still only 6 points behind the leaders with all to play for.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we play another struggling team, this time Stamford at The Grove. Let's hope for three points this time to keep us right in the hunt for promotion.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Jones, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Amos, Cowley (Skidmore 67), Moore (Haarhoff 67), Lamey, Steane (Baker 67), Forsdick. Unused Sub: Cooper, Danks</p>
  <p>Halesowen's Jekyll and Hyde unpredictability was in evidence again as they slipped to a disappointing defeat, only two days after an impressive away win at Chesham.</p>
  <p>Double-act Canham and Ball may sound more like an end-of-pier comedy show, but it was no laughing matter on a depressing evening for the Yeltz on the date labelled in the media as Blue Monday - apparently the low point of the year.</p>
  <p>Halesowen wasted their chance to use a game in hand to move into 4th spot in the table and Marc CANHAM scored the opener on 9 minutes with a great strike after a headed clearance from Nick Amos fell to him just outside the box. The only chance of note for Halesowen in a poor first half came when Nathan Lamey turned his defender on the edge of the box but goalkeeper Darren Chitty produced a splendid save.</p>
  <p>Lamey then missed a good chance just after the break after picking up the ball from Ben Steane's left-wing cross. A 51st minute mistake in the visiting defence almost led to the second Bath goal but goalkeeper Chris Taylor did well to deny Luke Prince. Canham then went close to his second a minute later when his effort from Prime's cross fell just wide.</p>
  <p>Manager Paul Holleran made a triple 67th minute substitution and Halesowen had a great chance to equalise when Jimmy Haarhoff slipped a through ball to Simon Forsdick but Chitty made a fine save.</p>
  <p>But it was all over for the Yeltz on 76 minutes when Alex BALL headed in a free-kick from Matt Lewis at the near post to make it 2-0. Even worse almost followed when Team Bath were awarded an 85th minute penalty for a push on Prime but the spot-kick from substitute Tomas Jaukovic was saved by Taylor.</p>
  <p>Not even the luckiest pair of socks, the trickiest completed crossword, the hottest five-bean chilli or the most spiritual Woodhenge matchstick arrangement (there you go Andy) could help Halesowen fans so, not for the first time this season, defeat to a lower league side followed after beating a higher placed team, leaving the need to capitalise on home games to make progress back up the table.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2005/01/22/CRUCIAL.html">CRUCIAL</a></h2>
    <h3>Chesham 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>With a most important victory away at Chesham, the indomitable Yeltz stayed firmly in the ridiculously close promotion battle. First half goals from Lewis and The Pope and some resolute defending has taken us up to  7th place in the table  but a lot closer after most of the other results went our way. More details in my old-skool stylee match report (DJ couldn't make it!)</p>
  <p>On Monday we play the first of three matches against teams in the relegation zone when we travel down to play Team Bath. If we are really going to challenge this season I think we need at least seven (and hopefully nine!) of these points so lets hope for a victory to cash in our game in hand.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from Poll</h3>

  <p>Yeltz: Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Preston, Pope, D. Jones, Haywood, Cowley, Forsdick, Baker, Moore, Lamey. Subs used: Danks, Steane, Haarhoff</p>
  <p>As anyone who can remember as far back as the old fanzine, accuracy (or relevancy) in the match reports was never our strong point, but with Dave not able to make the game and myself and Franko getting excited about travelling to a game on the Tube, it's left to me to try to record what might have happened...</p>
  <p>Pre-game discussion centered around lucky omens. After the sad demise of my lucky socks a few years ago due to overuse, my sure fire tip for success is having a Five Bean Chilli from Wetherspoons before the game (the reason both for our excellent cup run and for us losing at Yeading when I couldn't find one), whereas Frank reckons we need to get all the pictures in the quiz in The Independent for us to win. Quiz being completed, we gambled on concentrating on beer (hence not going to Ws) and once again it was proved I AM NOT THE JINX when we went out and got our best result since I was last at the game against Merthyr.</p>
  <p>Their ground was fantastic. Average terracing, poor pitch (although not bad for this time of year) but their clubhouse bar had an excellent view of the pitch - perfect! For what ever reason we had switched to the white away shirts despite having played in blue at The Grove when they played in their Villa kits, which meant we had almost exactly the same kit as their keeper - no idea how that can be allowed.</p>
  <p>We reverted to the team that got us off to the excellent start to the season (except with Nathan replacing Jimmy) which meant no place for the returning to fitness Andy Spencer (who??? :-)) and Ben Steane. We started off pretty well, and then deservedly took the lead through a very well worked corner. Fozzy played a short corner back to Alex to drag their defence out of the box, and he put a magic cross on to the head of Lewis, who as ever put it away brilliantly.</p>
  <p>There wasn't much in it for the rest of the half until we got a free-kick on the edge of the box which, when The Pope takes one of his free-kicks, is almost as good as a penalty. As usual it's very hard to know exactly what happened but to be technical, he wellied it and it went through everyone and went in. Job done, two up so we could retire to the bar for a while.</p>
  <p>Second half they had most of the play, and to be fair completely outplayed us playing some decent football at times. However we defended brilliantly and they probably only had one decent chance when their forward scooped it over from what looked like close-range. The Yeltz fans were in good voice in a strange stand that had excellent acoustics but with a very strange Giants Causeway/Woodhenge affair at the front. Like I say a fantastic ground.</p>
  <p>So with Team Bath, Stamford, Hemel Hempstead, and Rugby coming up I really hope we can take this excellent form on with us against the lower-placed teams (and not do another Solihull). Even those amongst you who haven't been coming long must have worked out your lucky omens by now, so don't falter now - however bizarre your rituals may be.</p>

    <h3>Bath City 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz once again came from behind to gain a point at Bath City. Nathan Lamey scored his 6th goal in 5 games to keep us in  8th place  just 6 points from the top. Full details as usual in DJ's match report.</p>
  <p>We've got next Saturday off - it's a Trophy weekend - so we don't play until Monday the 17th when we travel to Hednesford in the League Cup. It's been a hectic period recently so let's hope the rest does us good and we can push on from here to make a challenge for promotion in the second half of the season.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bath City: Evans; Rollo, Coupe, S. Jones, Bailey, Trought, Benefield, Caskey, Partridge (Corbett 71), Williams, Cleverley (Milton 73). Unused Subs: Hulbert, Owers, Shuttlewood.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Forsdick, Preston, Pope, D. Jones, Cowley, Moore, Lamey (Haarhoff 87), Amos, Skidmore (Haywood 31). Unused Subs: Danks, Steane</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Field (Chesham)  Attendance: 659  Booked: None</p>
  <p>Halesowen recovered from a poor start to claim a point with a tremendous second-half fight-back at Twerton Park.</p>
  <p>Ex-league stars Darren Caskey and John Williams proved to be troublesome for Halesowen's defence early on but the home side failed to build on their early lead.</p>
  <p>Caskey surged forward on his debut in the 9th minute but his shot was deflected away for the first of two Bath corners. Four minutes later Steve Pope made an important challenge to deny Scott Partridge who found plenty of space down the left after when set clear by Ben Cleverley.</p>
  <p>WILLIAMS put the Romans ahead in the 16th minute when his side-footed volley looped over Halesowen goalkeeper Chris Taylor in apparent slow motion from Cleverley's cross. Taylor was then quick to race off his line in the 26th minute to deny Partridge from a quickly taken free-kick.</p>
  <p>Halesowen created very little in the first half although Simon Forsdick hit a 22-yard drive well over the bar after 32 minutes and home goalkeeper Paul Evans easily collected a free-kick from substitute Dave Haywood - a replacement for Stuart Skidmore who required seven stitches to a leg injury. In the last minute of the first half, Caskey burst forward again to set up Partridge but Pope cleared again.</p>
  <p>The second half proved to be a different story as hearty Halesowen took control and played with greater confidence. Two minutes after the interval Forsdick broke up a Bath attack and raced forward, but he lacked support from the Halesowen front-runners. The Yeltz were unfortunate in the 50th minute when Nathan Lamey looked to have been held back in front of goal by goalkeeper Evans after Alex Cowley headed on a left wing cross from Forsdick, but the referee waved play on. A minute later Lamey poked just wide from close range and Ian Cooper fired narrowly over the bar from another good move as Halesowen kept up the pressure.</p>
  <p>Caskey shrugged off several challenges before seeing his 58th minute shot deflected away and from the resulting corner a back-heel from Williams seemed to beat Taylor but Forsdick tidied up on the goal-line. Partridge fired wide on the break in the 61st minute and Taylor collected Sam Bailey's header a minute later before Pope screwed a shot wide from Cooper's cross at the other end.</p>
  <p>Halesowen grabbed their well-deserved equaliser in the 72nd minute when Jason Moore was allowed to advance by the Bath defence and LAMEY hammered home from 8 yards out. Two minutes later Lamey worked his way into the area again but blasted wide from a good position. Bath were restricted to a series of half chances in the remainder of the game although Taylor made a fine blocking save to deny Caskey in injury time.</p>
