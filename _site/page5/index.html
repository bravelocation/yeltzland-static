    <h3>Solihull 3 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Football is a confusing game. How can we be so good against Merthyr and then lose to Solihull? Still if it was predictable we'd soon get bored. Full details in  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=03012005">Dave's match report</a> .</p>
  <p>We continue yet another long run of away games on Saturday when we travel to play Bath City. They are down in 15th place but in this crazy league they're only 7 points behind us. Let's hope it's one of our good days!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Solihull Borough: Gayle; Smith, Hier, Adams, A. Cooper, Peer, Jackson, Titterton, Hawker, Shepherd (Voice 78), R. Taylor. Unused Subs: Robinson, Petty, Faulds</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: C. Taylor; I. Cooper (Amos 78), Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley (Haarhoff 67), Danks (Moore 67), Lamey, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Steane.</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Miller (Kettering)              Attendance: 383  &#xD;
Booked: Haywood (49), Lamey (83).</p>
  <p>Nathan Lamey grabbed his fourth goal of the festive season but could not prevent Halesowen losing their fourth league game out of six in a dire display.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were barely recognisable from the side that beat top of the table Merthyr just two days earlier as they slumped to the bottom side Solihull in an unhappy return to Damson Park for Yeltz manager Paul Holleran and five of his players all recruited from Solihull. Nick Amos was also announced as the new Halesowen player-coach and takes over from Darren Grocutt who left just before Christmas.</p>
  <p>A 6th minute corner was met by Lamey at the far post after being missed by former Halesowen goalkeeper Mark Gayle but the home defence cleared for a corner. Solihull's Matt Hawker broke free down in the 11th minute but the ball was eventually cleared in a scramble with both Marcus Jackson and Rob Taylor going close. Not for the first time this season, Jackson continued to prove troublesome for Halesowen as he flashed an 18th minute shot wide with the Yeltz defence wide open again before Halesowen's Lewis Baker headed Alex Cowley's free-kick just wide.</p>
  <p>Solihull took a 23rd minute lead with the help of comical defending when a back header from Dan Jones only found HAWKER and his lob beat goalkeeper Chris Taylor who was well off his line. Two minutes later Taylor recovered to make a good save from Morton Titterton's shot and at the other end Baker's 27th minute shot struck Martin Hier's arm but only a corner was awarded.</p>
  <p>LAMEY equalised with a fine 29th minute header beyond Gayle from Cowley's short corner. Ten minutes before the interval Gayle made an important blocking save from Lamey from ten yards.</p>
  <p>Instead of building on Lamey's leveller, the visitors put on a wretched second half performance and fell behind again in the 48th minute when Rob TAYLOR picked up a loose ball and drilled home a low shot from 22 yards. Halesowen goalkeeper Chris Taylor then lost a 64th minute free-kick from Carl Adams but the ball fell safely and Halesowen escaped. Solihull added a third goal on 68 minutes when Jackson was allowed to advance and his shot beat Chris Taylor again from 20 yards with Mark SHEPHERD free to tap home the rebound off the post.</p>
  <p>Halesowen hardly mustered a second half chance until Nicki Preston headed an 81st minute corner wide and labouring substitute Jason Moore was set up by Lamey five minutes from time but wasted the opportunity.</p>

    <h3>Gloucester 3 Yeltz 3 and Yeltz 1 Merthyr 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The great thing about this season is that we've built up a great team spirit on the field, which showed up with two excellent battling performances over the holiday period. A fight back from three goals down at Gloucester was followed by a very hard fought victory over league leaders Merthyr on New Year's Day.</p>
  <p>You can read full details of both games in Dave's match reports, but I'd just like to add what a fantastic performance it was against Merthyr in the worst conditions I can remember for a long time. Nathan's goal was fantastic, and we fully deserved the victory.</p>
  <p>Going into 2005 we really have got all to play for. We're currently  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=01012005">5th in the table</a> , but still have a game in hand on the leaders. However only 9 points separate 2nd from 15th(!) place so it's going to be an exciting second-half of the season.</p>
  <p>One thing I have noticed on the site in the last year is lots of new fans getting involved. This is always good news, but I just want to remind everyone about what this site (and club) is all about. Yeltzland is not or never will be an official site, but it's run (and paid for!) by me in my spare time for the benefit of Yeltz fans. For that reason it's ultimately down to me what goes on the site - even though it takes a lot more effort to keep on top of things - because I strongly believe the quality of everyone's experience is helped my me deleting the usual abusive messages most unmoderated forums end up being. If that ends up with people occasionally feeling frustrated that they are not being heard, I can only say I'm doing what I think best for everyone.</p>
  <p>The website (and fanzine before it) always had an excellent relationship with the club - the reason for this being we are not a Man Utd. or WBA; we're a small non-league club where everyone knows each other. The benefit of this is that whenever you have any issues with how the club is run, you can talk to the board members directly - they're probably standing next to you in the crowd. This is the reason why I won't allow personal insults written at them on this site - if you've got something to say to them find them at the game and say it to them directly not through this website. This doesn't mean that no criticism is allowed, but there are limits.</p>
  <p>OK enough of me going on - I hope everyone has a happy 2005, and we can continue to enjoy and appreciate what has been sor far one of the best seasons I can remember in many years.</p>

    <h3>WSC QF  Kidderminster 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The Yeltz got back to winning ways last night with a 2-0 win over Kiddy's kids in the Worcester Senior last night. Goals from Nathan Lamey and Alex Cowley puts us through to the semi-finals and a mouth-watering tie against Redditch.</p>
  <p>Despite a few recent setbacks, the club is in a very healthy state at the moment after an excellent cup run, and for the first time in a long while a passing team who try to play good football. We've slipped down to 6th, but have games in hand and are all set to make a good run for promotion.</p>
  <p>We've got three important games over the holiday period - starting with a lovely trip to Gloucester on Monday (27th) followed by the big one at The Grove when league leaders Merthyr wist on New Years Day. If we could get 6 points from those games we'd be right back in the title race, so let's hope for the best!</p>
  <p>I'm off on my Xmas travels next week, so after Saturday the site may not be updated as quickly as usual. Merry Xmas to you all, and I'll hopefully see a lot of you on New Years Day for the big match.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Kidderminster H: Danby (Lewis 70); Astley, Evans, Manship, Hodnett, Teraud, Byrne, Malcolm, Butler, Thompson, Ludlow. Unused Subs: Burton, Gleeson.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Amos, Jones, Cowley, Moore, Danks, Lamey (Forsdick 67), Skidmore. Unused Subs: Grocutt, Strachan.</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Dorr (Worcester)  Attendance: 224&#xD;
Booked: Amos (36), Preston (44), Skidmore (84), Manship (84)</p>
  <p>Halesowen were too strong for Kidderminster's youth team in a confidence boosting performance after their recent lack of form.</p>
  <p>Nick Amos gave a dominant performance at the heart of the defence in place of absent Steve Pope with the hosts barely registering a clear attempt on goal all evening and Paul Danks worked hard up front after his recall from Solihull.</p>
  <p>In the 2nd minute Jason Moore went close and Nathan Lamey headed a corner over the bar. Lamey then beat the offside trap in the 28th minute but goalkeeper John Danby made a fine save. Seconds later Danby made another fine save from Lamey and Danny Hodnett cleared off the line as Moore followed up from the rebound. Moore skipped through a couple of challenges in the 43rd minute to set up Alex Cowley but Danby raced out to make another blocking save.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's pressure eventually brought a first half injury time goal when Lamey turned in the area to finally beat Danby from 15 yards after Moore shielded the ball.</p>
  <p>Simon Forsdick was introduced in the 67th minute after being delayed on his journey to Aggborough and was put free on the left in the 74th minute but substitute goalkeeper Daniel Lewis rushed off his line to save. Lewis was then on hand to block from Forsdick again on 77 minutes after being put through by Cowley.</p>
  <p>Kidderminster youngsters exerted late pressure but Halesowen held firm and broke away to notch a second goal in injury time when Danks put Cowley clear and he ran towards goal from 40 yards out before cheekily chipping past Lewis.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Chesham 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Our miserable December continued on Saturday when we lost again, this time going down 2-1 at home to Chesham. We should have had an early penalty when Fozzie was brought down, but then the game became very scrappy. They took the lead with a lucky deflection, but after the break we started to play a bit and deservedly equalised, once again through The Pope. However, when they scored again on the break all the belief drained out of us, and despite a bit of pressure we never really looked like getting back into it.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we play our last game before Xmas when we travel to Kiddy in the Worcester Senior. They're on a bad run too, but I suspect neither team is particularly bothered about the outcome (to preempt the moaners who will undoubtedly trot out the usual dull arguments if we turn out a weakened team and lose).</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper (Skidmore 81), Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Moore (Lamey 65), Forsdick, Baker, Amos (Danks 65). Unused Subs: Strachan, Grocutt</p>
  <p>Chesham United: Jackson; Sinclair, Sweeney, West, Clifford, Aldridge, Yates, Fotheringham (Reed 85), Richardson (Callender 79), Lawford, Scarlett. Unused Subs: Deacon, Hole, Hughes</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Banks (Bicester) Attendance: 444 Booked: Lawford (68), Pope (78), Haywood (84).</p>
  <p>Halesowen's disastrous December continued as they slumped to their 3rd consecutive defeat. The GX Team of the Month award prior to the game proved ironic with the former league leaders lacking confidence as they desperately tried to recapture their early season form.</p>
  <p>With nothing going their way, Halesowen's Simon Fordsick looked to have won a 2nd minute penalty when a header from Lewis Baker put him clear on goal. Having safely controlled the ball, Forsdick was about to pull the trigger when he went down from a Simon Sweeney challenge, but the referee waved play on.</p>
  <p>Chris Taylor made a fine 8th minute one-handed save from tricky wide-man Andre Scarlett after he beat Dan Jones down the left. Opposite goalkeeper Jamie Jackson then saved from Forsdick after Nick Amos headed down and Baker worked his way through the Chesham defence in the 17th minute but Jason Moore could only hook the ball at Jackson.</p>
  <p>Despite long periods of possession, the Yeltz lacked a cutting edge and Chesham took the lead in the 29th minute when a long free-kick from Peter Clifford was only half cleared, leaving Neil YATES to beat Taylor from 15 yards with the help of a deflection off Steve Pope. In a good spell for the visitors, a 39th minute header from John Richardson fell on top of the net and John Lawford sent a 30-yard free-kick inches high on 41 minutes. A minute before the break Peter Clifford hung in the air to head Lawford's corner wide from close range.</p>
  <p>There was no lack of effort from the Yeltz in the second half and Pope hit a 48th minute free-kick at the Chesham defensive wall. POPE then levelled the scores in the 49th minute by hitting home into the roof of the net from three yards out after fellow defender Nicki Preston turned Dave Haywood's corner back across the face of goal. In a good spell of passing play Forsdick headed at Jackson in the 55th minute but the Yeltz failed to build on the equaliser and switched off again at the back as Chesham regained the lead when SWEENEY was allowed to advance and hit a 20-yard drive beyond Taylor.</p>
  <p>Chesham defended their lead solidly in the final half-hour, restricting Halesowen to an 80th minute effort when Haywood hammered a 25-yard drive just wide. In the final minute Lawford struck just wide of Taylor's post.</p>

  <p>The mighty Yeltz fell to the second defeat in successive games, losing disappointingly 3-1 at The Grove to Hitchin. Full details in  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=11122003#DJ">Dave's match report</a> .</p>

Sponsors' Halesowen Town Man of the Match: Ian Cooper</p>
  <p>Early Christmas gifts were handed out as Halesowen surrendered their unbeaten home record in an unhappy return to the Grove after weeks on the road.</p>
  <p>Halesowen made a dreadful start by falling behind in the 3rd minute when the defence was caught napping and failed to clear Mark Bridge's cross allowing Shane HILL's shot to creep home.</p>
  <p>The flowing football and promise of earlier in the season was lacking and it was the cash-strapped Canaries who displayed great team spirit to record their first win under new manager Darren Salton. Halesowen did still create the main chances but their finishing was woefully off-target on the day. Simon Forsdick volleyed over the bar in the 17th minute after Alex Cowley won a corner and Forsdick then put Richard Burgess free two minutes later but he missed the target from 15 yards. Hitchin goalkeeper Richard Wilmot easily collected a couple of 34th minute crosses from Forsdick and Dan Jones and on 39 minutes Burgess flicked the ball on for out-of-form Jason Moore to slice wide in front of goal. A minute before the interval Forsdick was wayward again from 12 yards when put through by Nick Amos.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to struggle in the second half and it was Hitchin substitute Bilal Hassan who cut in from the left to fire just wide on 49 minutes. Sponsors' man of the match Ian Cooper then cleared a dangerous 52nd minute Bridge cross with Hill set to pounce.</p>
  <p>Hitchin increased their lead in the 61st minute when the persistence of Darren HAY helped him surge into the area and shrug off half-hearted challenges from the home defence and goalkeeper Chris Taylor to bundle the ball home from close range. Two minutes later Taylor was almost caught out again by Hay breaking down the left but managed to claw the ball away.</p>
  <p>On 64 minutes Moore headed weakly at visiting goalkeeper Wilmot and six minutes later Wilmot juggled the ball from a Burgess cross with Forsdick closing in. Wilmot then produced a fine 74th minute save when Forsdick at last struck a shot on target for Halesowen as the hosts won three successive corners. Amos then headed a cross from Forsdick over the bar in front of goal after 77 minutes.</p>
  <p>More misery followed for Halesowen as Hitchin went 3-0 ahead in the 81st minute when Aaran CAVILL was left free to drill home a rebound from the edge of the area after Taylor made a good blocking save from Bridge with only Hitchin's fourth attempt on target.</p>
  <p>Captain Steve POPE headed home an 83rd minute consolation goal from Dave Haywood's right-wing corner but it was too little, too late. In the dying minutes Forsdick's late effort was disallowed after Cowley barged into Wilmot and Wilmot blocked from Burgess in front of goal in injury time.</p>

    <h3>Aylesbury 1 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz lost their place on top of the league when they went down 1-0 to Aylesbury on Saturday. It was a pretty average game all in all, with our usual good passing game missing for some reason. However it really should have been 0-0 despite a pretty decent late goal for them.</p>
  <p>The mood wasn't helped when we found out Yeading had been drawn at home to Newcastle in the 3rd Round of the FA Cup. I think we'd all like to wish them the very best, but you really can't help but think it should have been us hosting The Toon down The Grove. I suppose there is always next year ...</p>
  <p>On Saturday we finally get a home game when  <a href="http://www.hitchintownfc.co.uk/">Hitchin</a>  are the vistitors. They are solidly in mid-table and lost at home to Histon and Merthyr in their last two games, so it's important we get back to winning ways to stay in touch with the teams who look at present to be our main rivals.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Aylesbury United: Rashid; Williams, Mead, Gould (Powles 70), Hayward, Folds, Cracknell, Barnett, C. Baker (Lazarus 54), Gutzmore (Gray 79), Edgeworth. Unused Subs: Sintim, Alabaster.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper (Grocutt 89), Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Moore, Burgess (Lamey 70), Amos (L. Baker 74), Forsdick. Unused Sub: Skidmore.</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Miller (Northampton)  Attendance: 382</p>
  <p>Halesowen threw away a point by conceding a late goal in a game of few chances.</p>
  <p>The Ducks started smartly on an excellent playing surface with Dave Haywood forced to turn away a testing left-wing cross from the left in the 2nd minute. Goalkeeper Chris Taylor punched the resulting corner clear but Leon Barnett drove the ball back in and Simon Forsdick cleared Colin Baker's shot off the line when a goal seemed certain.</p>
  <p>Richard Burgess blasted over the home crossbar in the 8th minute but on 19 minutes Aylesbury's Paul Edgeworth dispossessed Nick Amos before skewing the ball wide. On 23 minutes Alex Cowley struck wide from 20 yards from the right and five minutes later Amos headed on Steve Pope's free-kick for Jason Moore to hook a shot at goalkeeper Jack Rashid. Dan Jones was beaten in the box in the 30th minute but Jay Gould's close range shot was turned away for a corner. Barnett then flashed a 25-yard shot past the post and Edgeworth took advantage of an error by Jones to screw wide on 36 minutes.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finished the first-half strongly with a clever Forsdick pass setting up Burgess in the 38th minute before Amos set up Burgess to slice a half-volley well wide in the area three minutes later. Two minutes before the interval Forsdick broke away again and Haywood crossed for Cowley to send a diving header just wide.</p>
  <p>The stalemate continued early in the second half although Leon Gutzmore volleyed over the bar for the hosts in the 49th minute. Halesowen then enjoyed another good spell with Burgess making a fine turn in the area to force Rashid to parry away for a 61st minute corner. Rashid recovered to collect from Amos in the 62nd minute and then claimed the ball from Burgess three minutes later.</p>
  <p>Halesowen failed to shore up their defence and settle for a deserved point as Aylesbury looked for a late winner. Substitute Neil Lazarus blazed a 79th minute volley over the bar at the far post after Dean Cracknell's left wing cross exposed the visiting defence. EDGEWORTH finally broke the deadlock to win the game in the 86th minute by breaking into the area from the left to smash home superbly into the far corner.</p>
  <p>With little time left to reply, Pope hit a 20 yard shot over the Aylesbury bar in the final minute but in injury time Halesowen goalkeeper Taylor saved when substitute Danny Gray cut in to shoot from the left.</p>

    <h3>Banbury 1 Yeltz 4</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz went back to the top of the table with an emphatic 4-1 victory at Banbury on Saturday. Goals from Preston, The Pope, a Burgess cracker and a fourth from Nick Amos (according to everyone who was there) took us above Merthyr who didn't play. Hurrah!</p>
  <p>Next Saturday we travel once again, this time to  <a href="http://www.aylesburyunited.co.uk/">Aylesbury</a> . They've faded somewhat since their excellent start and are now down in mid-table, so let's hope we can keep our excellent form going and stay ahead of the chasing pack.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Banbury United: Tricker; Essex (McKay 51), Jackson (Stidder 82), Sullivan, Burnham, O'Neill, Stanbridge, Blossom, Fuller, Redknap, Potter (Pond 82).</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Burgess, Lamey (Baker 50), Amos, Forsdick (Skidmore 82). Unused Subs: Grocutt, Moore</p>
  <p>Referee: W. Ramsay (Coventry)  Attendance: 392</p>
  <p>Injury-hit Halesowen took full advantage of a game in hand to move back to the top of the table.</p>
  <p>The victory keeps up a sequence of 15 games in which the Puritans have failed to beat the Yeltz, spanning a period of 40 years since a 7-2 reversal way back in 1964-5.</p>
  <p>In a bright start, Simon Forsdick embarked on a weaving run in the 2nd minute before hitting over the bar from 20 yards and the visitors forced two 4th minute corners. Halesowen took the lead when Forsdick won a 6th minute corner and the Banbury defence allowed Dave Haywood's corner kick to drop for Niki PRESTON to steam in and convert at close range.</p>
  <p>George Redknap poked Liam O'Neill's free-kick just wide for the hosts on 11 minutes before the Yeltz raced into a two-goal lead. Alex Cowley's left-wing free-kick caught out Banbury's defence again and captain Steve POPE headed home unopposed. With the visitors well on top, both Pope and Nick Amos went close in a 17th minute goalmouth scramble from Haywood's corner.</p>
  <p>Yeltz goalkeeper Chris Taylor finally saw some action by collecting Andy Fuller's 21st minute shot from the edge of the area and Fuller then curled a 20 yard freekick against the outside of the post two minutes later. But Halesowen dominated the closing stages of the first half with Mark Essex clearing from Burgess from a quick Haywood break on 31 minutes and Nathan Lamey shielded the ball for Forsdick to force a fine save from goalkeeper Simon Tricker with a 20 yard drive two minutes later. Burgess then rattled the post on 34 minutes when he connected with a right-wing corner and Tricker saved the rebound from Lamey. After a series of 38th minute crosses caused further danger, Burgess struck high from a good position.</p>
  <p>Halesowen undid their good work and were pegged back to 2-1 against the run of play in the 41st minute when Fuller's deep freekick was turned into the path of Chris Potter and he beat Taylor from 10 yards.</p>
  <p>BURGESS eased any Halesowen worries by restoring the two goal advantage at the perfect time just two minutes into the second half by latching onto Lamey's pass and hitting a stunning 15-yard strike beyond Tricker. Cowley then cut in from the right but his 20-yard effort rebounded off Tricker's post on the hour and three minutes later Preston blazed over the bar in front of goal from Burgess's clever flick-on. Tricker then denied Preston on 65 minutes and Redknap cleared the resulting corner off the line. In one of their few second-half attacks, Banbury's Chris Jackson fired a 67th minute freekick just over the bar from 25 yards.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes from time AMOS added a fourth goal by rising above the home defence to head home another Haywood set piece.</p>

    <h3>BSC  Bedworth 2 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz cleverly managed to relieve themselves of another burden to their league campaign by managing to lose 2-1 to Bedworth in the B'ham Senior Cup. Despite taking the lead through Alex Cowley, they scored two before half-time to clinch the tie.</p>
  <p>In much more important matters, we have a chance to go back to the the top of the table on Saturday when we travel to  <a href="http://www.puritanical.net/">Banbury</a> . With most other teams playing in the Trophy, a win will take us back into first place which would be very nice!</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Ladek, Cooper, Cowley, Preston (c), Amos, Jones, Skidmore (Baker 52), Steane, Haarhoff, Burgess (Moore 65), Lamey (Forsdick 54). Unused Sub: Grocutt</p>
  <p>The Yeltz surprisingly bowed out of their third Cup competition in November to a team a division below them despite taking an early lead. With Chris Taylor given a rest, young goalkeeper Ladek took his up duty between the sticks on his debut after signing earlier in the season from Stourport Swifts. The visitors dominated the opening minutes with crosses into the penalty area from Ian Cooper causing some danger. The early pressure then paid off in the 17th minute when goalkeeper Lee Evans failed to hold Stuart Skidmore's shot and Alex COWLEY netted the rebound.</p>
  <p>However from this point on, Halesowen seemed to rest on their laurels for the remainder of the half and Bedworth were back on level terms when Matt COPPIN headed home Kristian Kelsall's long cross from the right. Coppin's 41st minute corner then provided the winner when a neat knock on by Scott Hadland sent James RICHARDSON into the area to blast home. Substitute forward Jimmy Haarhoff came on for the second half and proved an inspiration for Halesowen with his clever running and passing creating a string of chances. Nathan Lamey wasted the first chance, Jason Moore failed to reach the second and finally Simon Forsdick shot weakly at the goalkeeper. That was the pattern in the second half, with Town having most of the possession but never really looking like scoring. Bedworth themselves had chances to score through Joe Hanney and Lee Ross, but with an important FA Trophy game coming up on Saturday, they were just happy to hold on. On the other hand, Halesowen will feel it is a game they could have easily won with a better performance.</p>

    <h3>Hemel Hempstead 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The indomitable Yeltz gained a welcome three points on Saturday with a very welcome win away to Hemel Hempstead. Goals from recent signings Nick Amos and Nathan Lamey took us back up to  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=20112004"&gt;2nd place</a>  with a game in hand over leaders Merthyr. Full details in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we travel to  <a href="http://www.bedworthunited.co.uk/"&gt;Bedworth</a>  in the Birmingham Senior Cup, before yet another away trip to  <a href="http://www.puritanical.net/home.html"&gt;Banbury</a>  on Saturday for the rearranged league game.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Hemel Hempstead Town: Lovell; Neill, Leach, Allen, Jackson, Corbould, Kelly, Cook, Fowler, Hammatt, Harding. Subs: Bent, Buss, Perrin.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones (Haarhoff 71), Cowley, Lamey, Forsdick (Skidmore 85), Moore (Burgess 79), Amos. Unused Subs: Steane, Grocutt.</p>
  <p>Referee: G. Horwood (Luton)  Attendance: 220</p>
  <p>Halesowen produced an assured performance to finally banish their FA Cup blues and provide real hope of ensuring at least a play-off league position at the end of the season.</p>
  <p>Hemel had won their last three games but determined Town looked to put some indifferent recent form behind them and come away from the south east with at least a point for the first time this season. The visitors were without suspended and injured midfielder Lewis Baker but Alex Cowley recovered from a knock to make the starting line-up.</p>
  <p>The hosts applied the early pressure and George Fowler should have done better when he struck the side netting on 21 minutes and Chris Taylor then parried away Chris Hammatt's dangerous 26th minute cross. Halesowen's first chance fell to new-signing Nathan Lamey just before the half hour when he picked up the ball from a goal kick but his low shot was well saved by home keeper David Lovell.</p>
  <p>Nick AMOS gave the Yeltz the lead on 30 minutes to notch his first goal for the club with a looping shot from the edge of the area after a spell of pressure on the home goal.</p>
  <p>Predictably, Halesowen soaked up home pressure early in the second half with Taylor on hand again to save a 49th minute Matt Corbould header. But the Yeltz always looked capable of a goal on the break with Dave Haywood seeing a low shot well saved before setting up the second goal in the 64th minute. Haywood's long ball led to goalkeeper Lovell and his defence making a hash of a clearance and LAMEY on the chase took advantage to loft the ball into the net.</p>
  <p>Although Halesowen had further defending to do the introduction of substitute Jimmy Haarhoff was a masterstroke which almost paid off with two more goals. Firstly Haarhoff set up Haywood to hit the post on 86 minutes before hitting the woodwork himself with a low drive in the final minute.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Cirencester 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After the cup excitement of the wekend, a tired Yeltz side ground out a draw in the league at home to Cirencester. We took the lead through a welcome goal from Jason, but they equalised just before half-time. Full details in Dave's  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=16112004#DJ">match report</a> .</p>
  <p>We begin a run of three away league matches on Saturday when we travel to  <a href="http://www.hemeltownfc.com/">Hemel Hempstead</a> . They're near the bottom of the table but have won their last 3 games, but let's hope we can get back to winning ways as soon as possible.</p>
  <p/>
  <p/>
  <p/>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Forsdick, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley (Haywood 59), Burgess (Lamey 64), Moore (Haarhoff HT), Amos, Skidmore. Unused Sub: Steane</p>
  <p>Cirencester Town: Thompson; Richards, Halliday, Jackson, Bird, Howard, Robison, Mayo, Hopkins (Stanley 88), Griffin (Bevan 63), Wimble. Unused Subs: Fitch, Fraser</p>
  <p>Referee: L. Hodgson (Nuneaton)                      Attendance: 381&#xD;
Sponsors' Man of the Match: Chris Taylor       Booked: None</p>
  <p>Halesowen returned to league action but failed to raise their game after taking an early lead in a drab draw.</p>
  <p>Striker Nathan Lamey was signed prior to the game from Hinckley and took his place on the bench but Halesowen were then forced to name intended substitute Nick Amos as a late replacement when Lewis Baker pulled up in the pre-match warm-up.</p>
  <p>There was little action until Shaun Wimble struck wide from 20 yards for the visitors in the 15th minute but Halesowen lifted the spirits by taking the lead with their first meaningful attack on 18 minutes. Alex Cowley won the ball in midfield and the referee ignored an infringement to play the advantage allowing Richard Burgess to find Jason MOORE in the penalty area and he tucked away his first goal in 12 games from 12 yards at the second attempt.</p>
  <p>But the Yeltz couldn't build on the lead and the rest of the half belonged to the Centurions as the F.A. Cup hangover clicked in.</p>
  <p>Goalkeeper Chris Taylor did just enough to deny Gareth Hopkins near his post in the 21st minute and Michael Jackson struck a long-range effort wide six minutes later. Halesowen won the first corner of the game on 28 minutes but visiting goalkeeper Paul Thompson clawed the ball away from Simon Forsdick. Cirencester came back strongly to pin lack-lustre Halesowen back late in the first-half. Adam Howard headed straight into the arms of Taylor from five yards in the 34th minute from Wimble's free-kick and a minute later Taylor pushed away a Hopkins header for a corner from another dangerous Wimble cross. Taylor then collected a 37th minute drive from Darren Robison and on 42 minutes captain Steve Pope made a crucial headed clearance from Wimble's free-kick on the edge of the penalty area.</p>
  <p>It was no surprise when Cirencester equalised in the 44th minute when the home defence failed to clear after the ball was played in from the right and HOPKINS smashed home from 8 yards in a defensive skirmish.</p>
  <p>A disappointingly low-key second half saw Cirencester's Adam Mayo strike over the bar from 20 yards in the 49th minute and with Halesowen failing to fire on all cylinders Pope's 25-yard free-kick was blocked on 51 minutes. Forsdick shot weakly at Thompson a minute later but Forsdick was then on hand to save the day at the other end by clearing a Hopkins corner with the home defence all at sea. Hopkins then beat defender Dan Jones in the 56th minute but man-of-the-match Taylor turned the ball away for a corner. Taylor then lost the ball in a 69th minute corner but substitute Dave Haywood cleared off the Halesowen line before the hosts finally injected some urgency into their play late on.</p>
  <p>Centurion goalkeeper Thompson received lengthy treatment in the 70th minute after an over-enthusiastic challenge from Stuart Skidmore but Nick Amos could only strike straight at the grateful 'keeper from 8 yards after latching onto Haywood's free-kick six minutes later. Haywood's 80th minute corner was then turned back across the face of Cirencester's goal by Niki Preston and Pope hit another 25-yard trademark direct free-kick at the defensive wall five minutes later. Lamey's 89th minute overhead kick fell just over the bar and Haywood's 90th minute cross was cleared off toe of Jimmy Haarhoff.</p>
  <p>Cirencester almost claimed all three points in the second minute of injury time when Taylor missed Wimble's free-kick but the ball evaded the visiting forward-line to run out for a goal-kick and preserve Halesowen's unbeaten home league record.</p>

    <h3>FAC 1R  Yeading 2 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's the hope that's the killer. The indomitable Yeltz once again lost in the First Round of The FA Cup and we're all left dreaming of what might have been.</p>
  <p> <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=13112004">Dave's match report</a>  gives full details on the day, but three disappointing things happened this weekend. The usual big-game idiots came with their ridiculous racist abuse, we got patronised by a completely ignorant BBC commentator in the interactive service and then Yeading go and draw Slough to have an excellent chance of getting through. Aaaaarrrrrrrggggggh!</p>
  <p>OK that's enough moaning. Let's remember the fantastic run we had (those unbelievable days at Gainsborough and Brigg) and celebrate that for the first time in years we've got a great footballing side who actually give us some hope.</p>
  <p>A quote from Paul sums it up perfectly: "It's over now - good luck to Yeading, but we must get on with the league. Our season starts here".</p>
  <p>It starts again in earnest on Tuesday night when we host Cirencester at The Grove. They are a decent team, but let's hope we can reproduce the form that led us to stuff them 5-0 down at their place earlier in the season.</p>
  <p>(P.S. The headline is courtesy of Greg who thought I wouldn't use it.)</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Yeading: Preddie; Barima (Behzadi 71), Protain, Saroya, Leach, Stanley, Clarke, Brown, Haule, Campbell (Woodruffe 90), Quamina. Unused Subs: Kleboe, Perfect, McArthur</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper (Strachan 80), Haywood (Steane 80), Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Haarhoff (Burgess 65), Moore, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Robinson.</p>
  <p>Referee: D. Whitestone (Northampton) Attendance: 524 Booked: Brown (45), Cooper (56), Haule (68)</p>
  <p>Halesowen's FA Cup dreams finally died at the Warren but the result was harsh on Halesowen who did enough to earn at least a draw.</p>
  <p>Yeltz manager Paul Holleran said he was "disappointed with the goals conceded - we shot ourselves in the foot again. However, we thought we were denied a second half penalty when Jason Moore's marker handled the ball."</p>
  <p>The tie brought together the pacesetters in the Ryman and Southern Premier leagues in an interesting comparison with both sides attempting to reach the 2nd Round for the first time in their history. Remarkably, Halesowen have been drawn away from home in ten of their last eleven FA Cup draws and they now miss out on another away tie at Ryman League Slough Town in the second round and a chance to progress to the big-time in the 3rd Round.</p>
  <p>The travelling army of fans made up most of the attendance at the Warren but the lack of support for the out-numbered hosts still lead to the lowest FA Cup attendance of day.</p>
  <p>League leaders Yeading were without suspended midfielder Keith Newby but it looked ominous for Halesowen when goalkeeper Chris Taylor was forced into a fine blocking save from Michael Barima in the 4th minute following a fine flowing move. Although the corner was cleared Alex Stanley crossed again from the right and the ball deflected cruelly off Dave HAYWOOD to beat Taylor at the near post in the 5th minute. Emond Protain then headed a 7th minute free-kick just wide.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz made the perfect response with a 9th minute equaliser when Niki Preston set Simon Forsdick free down the left and he beat his marker to cross for Alex COWLEY to fire through a crowded goalmouth beyond un-sighted goalkeeper Delroy Preddie from 15 yards. Forsdick then robbed Nevin Soroya but his 12th minute left-wing cross was cleared and a minute later Jason Moore almost break through when Darti Brown lost the ball. With Halesowen still enjoying a better spell, a 16th minute long throw from Cowley caused confusion before being cleared and on 21 minutes Cowley cut in from the right but his fierce shot was turned away for a corner by Preddie.</p>
  <p>Yeading's Barima was set free down the right in the 31st minute but his deep cross landed on top of the net during a spell of scrappy midfield play mid-way through the first half. With Halesowen creating the better chances late in the first half, Forsdick skipped through several midfield tackles in the 37th minute and set up Lewis Baker but Preddie grabbed his 20-yard effort. Two minutes later Jimmy Haarhoff slipped the ball to Forsdick but his shot was cleared for a corner. Three minutes before the interval Haywood latched onto a clearance to slam a 25-yard volley just over the bar.</p>
  <p>Brown was shown a yellow card for up-ending Ian Cooper in the 45th minute but there was heartbreak for Halesowen as they pushed forward from the free-kick with the clock already into the one minute of injury-time displayed by the fourth official. The ball broke to Barima down the right and his cross struck the arm of Dan Jones without a Yeading player nearby. The referee finally awarded the needless penalty after the assistant referee flagged for the infringement and Golden Boot striker Dudley Junior (DJ) Campbell tucked the ball into the corner of the net for the first-half injury-time winner despite unlucky goalkeeper Taylor diving brilliantly to get a hand to the ball.</p>
  <p>Davis Haule headed Saroya's 51st minute cross wide but little was seen of Yeading as an attacking force in the second half. With Halesowen trying to get back into the game, Forsdick was crowded out from Haywood's 52nd minute cross and on the hour Haarhoff laid the ball off for Cowley to evade a couple of tackles before firing at Preddie. Baker then made space to hit a 20-yard shot at Preddie in the 63rd minute and substitute Richard Burgess combined with Moore for Forsdick to screw just wide on 70 minutes.</p>
  <p>With time slipping away Forsdick took the ball down in the 80th minute but his goal-bound shot was blocked by Protain. Halesowen were then forced to play out the final minutes with ten men after unfortunate substitute Craig Strachan was stretchered off to hospital and required six stitches to a leg gash after less than a minute on the pitch following a rash challenge.</p>
  <p>The last chance for Halesowen fell for captain Steve Pope to hit a trademark direct 25-yard free-kick towards the top corner but Preddie produced a 90th minute acrobatic save.</p>
  <p>Not for the first time in the 1st Round Proper the after-match analysis left Halesowen with a feeling of what might have been.</p>
  <p>Ding manager Johnson Hippolyte admittted "my side didn't play well against a decent team. We were grateful for the experience of ex-Conference midfielder David Clarke, but I'm disappointed we never kicked-on from our early goal. We don't mind who we play next because we have made history for Yeading FC today".</p>
  <p>The last word on Halesowen's FA Cup adventure rested with Holleran. "It's over now - good luck to Yeading, but we must get on with the league. Our season starts here".</p>

    <p>
  <p>Although it's always disappointing to lose, in the big scheme of things maybe it's good that we're not distracted any more from the League? I'm not sure, but in any case we're out of the FA Trophy after losing 2-1 at Bromsgrove. Full details in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>Next week we play in the First Round of the FA Cup for a long time when we travel to West London to play Rymans Premier  <a href="http://www.yeadingfc.co.uk">Yeading</a> . They're obviously a decent team, but so are we and we've never had such a good opportunity to progress. I'm sure it'll be another great Cup away trip, and if we can at least get into the draw I'll be happy.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bromsgrove Rovers: Lowe; Benbow, Ulfig, Hillman, Collins, Mahon, M. Jackson, Allen, Mitchell (Szewczyk 71), Appleton, Campbell.  Unused Subs: Gandy, Banner, N. Jackson, Frost.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper (Steane 81), Haywood (Amos 70), Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Haarhoff (Moore 70), Burgess, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Robinson.</p>
  <p>Referee: O. Langford (Tipton)  Attendance: 522 Booked: Baker (40), Mitchell (44), Ulfig (59), Mahon (72)</p>
  <p>Halesowen fell at the first hurdle in the FA Trophy in a hard fought local derby against battling Bromsgrove.</p>
  <p>Arthur Appleton drove wide for the hosts in the 2nd minute and an Ian Cooper cross was cleared at the other end a minute later. Former Halesowen striker Leon Mitchell then broke clear down the left for the home side in the 8th minute and the ball fell for Ryan Mahon to hit a looping shot onto the crossbar with goalkeeper Chris Taylor beaten.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz won the first corner on 16 minutes and Lewis Baker struck the bar when goalkeeper Matt Lowe lost the ball in a crowded goalmouth after his defence initially cleared from Simon Forsdick. Marcus Jackson blasted at Taylor from the left on 22 minutes but a couple of minutes later Lowe did well to keep out a deflected shot from Forsdick and then saved low down from Alex Cowley.</p>
  <p>After a series of bruising tackles late in the first half, dead-ball specialist Steve Pope saw his 36th minute free-kick from the edge of the area deflected away for a corner.</p>
  <p>Two minutes into the second half Halesowen central defender Dan Jones drove a free-kick into the Bromsgrove area but Lowe collected as Forsdick failed to make a firm contact. Bromsgrove then upset the Premier pacesetters by taking a 49th minute lead in a flowing breakaway up the slope when Nicky CAMPBELL converted Marcus Jackson's right wing cross with a diving header.</p>
  <p>Baker headed just wide at the far post for the visitors on the hour from Dave Haywood's cross and Lowe dived at his post to keep out a 65th minute effort from Niki Preston with his defence scrambling away the resulting corner.</p>
  <p>In pulsating action Appleton scooped over the Halesowen bar from 12 yards in the 67th minute but then APPLETON headed home Bromsgrove's second goal directly from Steve Hillman's right wing free-kick in the 71st minute.</p>
  <p>Halesowen pulled a goal back in the 74th minute when Richard Burgess provided the final close-range touch beyond Lowe after substitute Nick Amos helped on a free-kick but Halesowen made little further impression on the home defence despite two late shots from substitute Ben Steane.</p>

    <p>
  <p>Another day, another win. Our good run continued last night with a 1-0 victory in the Worcester Senior Cup against Stourport through a Fozzy goal. We now play Kiddy in the next round.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we visit Bromsgrove in the FA Trophy, before next week's FA Cup First Round tie away at Ryman Premier Yeading.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Stourport Swifts: O'Malley; M. Jones, Shirley, Webb, A. Jones, Llloyd (Hayward 63 (Titterton 74)), Checketts, Sayer, Giddings (Hawkes 63), Atkinson, Mason. Unused Subs: Crisp, Gittings</p>

  <p>Referee: J. Cox (Evesham)              Attendance: 157</p>
  <p>Halesowen made five changes from the previous Saturday's line-up with one eye on the important FA Cup and FA Trophy matches ahead of them. Nevertheless, the visitors dominated for much of the game but had to rely Simon Forsdick's strike at the start of the second half to take them through to a second round clash away at Kidderminster Harriers.</p>
  <p>The first half saw Halesowen in total control with some neat passing but some solid defending kept them at arm's length. When Richard Burgess finally found some space in front of goal he was twice denied by home keeper Aaron O'Malley, the second of the saves an excellent stop at full-stretch.</p>
  <p>Mark Atkinson almost gave Swifts an unlikely lead 30 seconds into the second half when he pounced on a poor clearance from visiting keeper Chris Taylor but the Halesowen stopper recovered in time to keep out the shot. Three minutes later and it was the Yeltz who took the lead. Former Stourport favourite Alex Cowley combined with Burgess on the edge of the area before skewing his shot across goal where Forsdick was lurking to drill low past O'Malley.</p>
  <p>The Swifts finally come to life in the dying stages of the game but were denied by an offside flag and the woodwork. Dan Mason's 88th minute strike, off a Halesowen defender, was ruled out for offside and two minutes later, with the game entering injury time, Mason tried again but this time saw his thundering drive thump against the upright with keeper Taylor beaten.</p>

    <h3>FAC 4Q  Brigg 1 Yeltz 4</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Fantastic. The mighty Yeltz won through to the First Round of the FA Cup for the first time in 13 seasons with a hard-fought but well-deserved 4-1 victory over Brigg Town. We had the better of most of the game, but went one down before half-time, thankfully equalising not long afterwards. In the second-half they looked the better team for a while, but two screaming free kicks from The Pope and a brilliant lob by Burgess sent the large travelling support away very happy. I still haven't stopped smiling :-)</p>
  <p>Chas has sent me a  <a href="/news/images/matchphotos/2004-10-30.1.zip">movie clip of the 3rd goal</a> . It's a large file and a bit patchy but I think you'll enjoy it! You'll need to download it and unzip it first.</p>
  <p>I think we've got a decent draw, being away to  <a href="http://www.yeadingfc.co.uk/">Yeading</a> . They're based in West London and are currently top of the Rymans Premier so it's not going to be easy but we have a chance to make history and progress past the First Round for the first time.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we travel to Stourport in the Worcester Senior, before we have yet another cup tie on Saturday when we go to Bromsgrove in the Trophy.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Brigg Town: Steer; Ward, Waltham, Cochrane, Hope, Housham, Stones, Thompson, Roach, Chatterton, Ainsley. Subs: Cadman, Thorne, Tuck, Betts, Andrews</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Haarhoff, Moore (Burgess 76), Baker (Steane 86), Forsdick (Skidmore 80). Unused Subs: Robinson, Strachan.</p>
  <p>Referee: S. G. Cooke (Mansfield)     Attendance: 588     Booked: Preston (56)</p>
  <p>Captain Steve Pope hit two tremendous cannonball strikes directly from free-kicks to lift Halesowen into the First Round of the FA Cup for the first time in 13 years, although there was some disappointment at then being drawn away to fellow non-league Yeading.</p>
  <p>Understandably there was a degree of nervousness prior to the game with Brigg boasting a proud Cup tradition and matching Halesowen's record of lifting the FA Vase on two occasions. It was 18 years since Halesowen visited Brigg in the Vase and Mark Penn who was a member of that Vase winning squad was spotted amongst the large contingent of travelling fans.</p>
  <p>Halesowen could have killed the game early on and almost made a dream start after just 20 seconds on a perfect playing surface when Alex Cowley's cross fell to Dave Haywood but he struck a great chance wide. Haywood then delivered a fine 9th minute cross to cause chaos in the home defence and a looping header from Lewis Baker rebounded off the crossbar with home goalkeeper Damien Steer beaten a minute later.</p>
  <p>Brigg's Ross Thompson hit a loose ball over the bar from 25 yards in the 13th minute before Halesowen's Jason Moore nipped in between the last defender and goalkeeper Steer to poke the ball into the side-netting. Home striker Simon Roach turned to fire wide in the 16th minute but four minutes later Halesowen won their first corner when Simon Forsdick's shot was fisted away from Cowley's cross. With Halesowen on top, Pope then forced a second corner before Pope tidied up in his own defence on 27 minutes after Niki Preston was dispossessed. Steer then punched clear in the 32nd minute and Lee Cochrane saved the home side by heading Pope's header off the line from the resulting corner.</p>
  <p>The home side stunned Halesowen by taking the lead against the run of play in the 39th minute when Paul CHATTERTON broke free to chip goalkeeper Chris Taylor with the visiting defence appealing for an offside decision. Halesowen responded immediately and levelled a minute later although the ultimate goalscorer remained shrouded in mystery. COWLEY made the last decisive Halesowen touch when his free-kick from a tight angle on the edge of the area struck the far post and crept into the net with the aid of a fumble from goalkeeper Steer, although Pope later claimed the goal to record his hat-trick.</p>
  <p>Three minutes into the second half Jimmy Haarhoff turned but shot straight at Steer. However it was the Zebras who dominated the start of the second half and were first to the ball in a strangely low-key period for Halesowen with Roach forcing his way down the right to smash into the side-netting in the 61st minute.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally started to fire on all cylinders in the final quarter of the game and on 68 minutes Cowley set up Moore to play a one-two and force Steer into a fine save. POPE then gave Halesowen the lead in the 70th minute with a screaming direct free-kick from the edge of the area leaving Steer and his defensive wall rooted to the spot after live-wire Haarhoff was brought down. Haarhoff then chased free down the left and cut the ball back to Moore but his side-foot shot allowed Steer to make a crucial save. Brigg then kept out Preston's goal-bound header from Haywood's 77th minute corner.</p>
  <p>Remarkably, POPE then crashed home a mirror-image goal direct from another identically positioned free-kick with the help of a slight deflection in the 80th minute after Cowley was fouled. With Brigg's spirit finally broken substitute Richard BURGESS notched a fourth goal with a neat chip over Steer in the 86th minute and in injury time Steer made two saves from Haarhoff who broke clear on goal. The final whistle was greeted by jubilant scenes with supporters and players sharing the celebrations.</p>

    <h3>Bedford 3 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It was good while it lasted, but our long unbeaten run came to an end on Saturday when we lost 3-0 away at Bedford. Three second-half goals pushed us down to '2nd place' on alphabetical order 'behind' Chippenham. Full details in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>We start a run of Cup games on Saturday with the trip to  <a href="http://www.briggtownfc.co.uk/">Brigg</a>  in the final qualifying round of the FA Cup. Despite being a league below us they have an excellent cup pedigree and won the Vase last year, so it's not going to be easy. However it's about as good a draw as we could have hoped for at this stage. Let's hope for a performance as good as the one at Gainsborough in the last round and hope we can get through to the First Round for the first time in quite a few years now.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: C. Taylor; Cooper (Forsdick 64), Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Haarhoff (Burgess 64), Moore, Baker, Skidmore (Amos 64). Unused Subs: Steane, R. Robinson.</p>
  <p>Bedford Town: J. Robinson, Jackman, J. Taylor, Rydeheard, Howarth, James (Goodrham 84), Challinor (Blake 82), Stupple, Dillon, McElroy, Okai (Wheale 80). Unused Subs: None</p>
  <p>Referee: J. Wynne (Dunstable)  Attendance: 420    Booked: None</p>
  <p>The Eagles soared high with a three quick-fire goals at the start of the second-half ending Halesowen's eleven game unbeaten run.</p>
  <p>After a quiet start in the relentless rain, Lewis Baker dispossessed defender James Taylor but fired just wide from the edge of the penalty area. At the other end a measured 15th minute cross from ex-Dunstable wide-man Parys Okai was headed away for a corner by Dave Haywood and a minute later Bedford worked the ball to the right for Richard Challinor to shoot over the bar.</p>
  <p>Jason Moore laid the ball off for Jimmy Haarhoff to hit a 15-yard drive at goalkeeper James Robinson on 21 minutes and just after the half-hour Haywood delivered a sequence of three free-kicks from the right-wing straight into the arms of the Bedford goalkeeper. Niki Preston's 32nd minute long-range shot was deflected away for a corner and seconds before the interval visiting goalkeeper Chris Taylor took out a dangerous right-wing cross from Challinor.</p>
  <p>The even, low-key first-half gave few hints of a traumatic fifteen minutes that was about to follow. Three minutes after the restart Steve Pope attempted to beat one man too many and lost the ball in midfield, but Dan Jones did just enough to put off Chris Dillon as he ran through on goal. Bedford then went ahead in the 51st minute when Taylor failed to claim a deep free-kick from Jackman and Dean McELROY netted with a simple header.</p>
  <p>Pope flashed Haywood's corner just wide in the 53rd minute after Haarhoff won the ball but lack-lustre Halesowen fell two goals behind in the 58th minute after losing the ball in midfield allowing Dillon to break and cross from the left for Derwayne STUPPLE to bang home from close range.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's flaky defence was torn apart again in the 60th minute when McElroy crossed from the right to present DILLON with an easy tap-in past Taylor.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz never looked likely to retrieve the situation despite making three 64th minute substitutions. Robinson took Baker's header and opposite goalkeeper Taylor took McElroy's 66th minute header from Dillon's cross. Halesowen substitutes Richard Burgess and Simon Forsdick both struck wide before Bedford's McElroy saw his 79th minute strike disallowed for offside.</p>
  <p>Moore hit wide from Alex Cowley's cross in the final minute of a miserable afternoon for Halesowen that ended their record of scoring in every game this season.</p>

  <p>Our excellent run continued last night as we beat Hednesford 1-0 to got back to the top of the Premier Division table. A second-half goal from Jimmy clinched it, and with Chesham losing 7-2 to in-form Histon we moved back to the  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=19102004">top of the table</a>  on goal difference.</p>

</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Forsdick (Haywood 80), Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Haarhoff (Danks 86), Moore, Baker, Skidmore (Robinson 80). Unused Subs: Steane, Amos</p>
  <p>Hednesford Town: Young; Teesdale, Branch, Barrow, Brindley, Walters, Maguire (Anthrobus 76), Beckett (Charie 17), Bell, McSweeney, Gray. Unused Subs: Bailey, Rogers, Evans</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Barrow (Tamworth) Attendance: 521 Booked: Brindley (36), Skidmore (62), Walters (63), Pope (69), Gray (85), Preston (87).</p>
  <p>A goal from leading marksman Jimmy Haarhoff was just enough to put Halesowen back on top of the table in their first league double over injury-hit Hednesford since 1988.</p>
  <p>The Pitmen were first to show with Andy Bell's 5th minute overhead kick landing on top of the net and Dan Jones then headed away Anthony Maguire's free-kick for the corner on 11 minutes.</p>
  <p>Haarhoff and Alex Cowley worked Halesowen's first corner on 13 minutes and three minutes later Hednesford goalkeeper Ryan Young produced a tremendous flying save to deny Lewis Baker's header from another Cowley corner. Dan Jones put Jason Moore through with a clear sight on goal on 22 minutes but he scooped over the bar from 15-yards. Haarhoff then fought to win the ball on the left wing in the 27th minute but his cross was just inches too high after a fine weaving run.</p>
  <p>Chris Brindley was given the first of six bookings in the game when he hacked down Haarhoff in the 36th minute and on 38 minutes Moore was put clear again but he hesitated in front of goal and the chance was lost. The Yeltz forced three corners in the 41st minute but Young saved on the line from Nicki Preston's close range header after a flick on from Moore. Just before the interval home goalkeeper Chris Taylor then collected from Brindley and Steve Pope blocked from Maguire.</p>
  <p>Two minutes into the second half a 30-yard free-kick from Pope was deflected for a corner and Cowley struck the side-netting.</p>
  <p>Simon Forsdick set up the decisive goal in the 51st minute by beating four Hednesford players in an inspirational run from midfield before slipping the ball for HAARHOFF on the left to beat Young from a tight angle just inside the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Lee Barrow then cleared from Moore down the left and Young collected another Baker header on the hour. After a period of niggly fouls that resulted in further bookings, Haarhoff put defender Jones free down the right but his shot was blocked and Pope hit a long-range free-kick wide on 70 minutes.</p>
  <p>With time running out for the visitors, Marlon Walters crossed from the right after Preston missed his challenge but Baker somehow managed to clear a goal-bound shot from substitute Steve Anthrobus off the line in the 80th minute. In injury time Andy Bell's shot was tipped away for a corner by goalkeeper Taylor's fingers with Leon McSweeney lurking at the far post.</p>

    <h3>FAC 3Q  Yeltz 4 Glasshoughton 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz continued their excellent cup form with a 4-1 win over Glasshoughton Welfare on Saturday. Two goals in either half gave us a reasonably comfortable win over a brave lower league side, and puts us just one win away from the First Round proper. Full details in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>The draw is on Monday, and I'll post it on the site as soon as I find out. Let's hope for either an easy game or a big team!</p>
  <p>On Tuesday Hednesford visit The Grove in the league. We beat them in a hard-fought game at their place earlier in the season, so let's hope for more of the same at home.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley (Steane HT), Haarhoff, Burgess (Moore 66), Baker (Skidmore 78), Forsdick. Unused Subs: Danks, Robinson</p>
  <p>Glasshoughton Welfare: Codd; Liversedge, Wilkes, Dobson, Mattison, Constable, Seed (Blair HT), Bradley, Parker, Newton, Woolford. Unused Subs: King, Haigh, Leech, Fieldhouse</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Lever (Leicester)     Attendance: 512     Bookings: None</p>
  <p>Free-scoring Halesowen shattered Glasshoughton's Cup dreams to earn a crack at the 4th Qualifying Round for the first time in seven years.</p>
  <p>After a scrappy first few minutes, Alex Cowley put Lewis Baker through in the 8th minute, but he tripped over the ball. Glasshoughton's Martin Woolford then ran through from his own half before eventually being crowded out on the edge of the Halesowen area. The Yeltz won the first corner of the game on 11 minutes and goalkeeper Karl Codd spilled the cross before recovering to make a fine blocking save from Steve Pope. Simon Forsdick then glanced a header off the far post from Dave Haywood's corner a minute later.</p>
  <p>Jimmy HAARHOFF put Halesowen in charge with his 8th goal of the season in the 13th minute by rounding Codd before calmly finishing into an empty net. Haarhoff then set up Baker a minute later, but he side-footed straight at Codd.</p>
  <p>The Northern Counties East Premier League visitors were far from over-awed and enjoyed plenty of possession mid-way through the first half and a 21st minute corner from Woolford was punched clear by Chris Taylor with Sean Constable cracking the rebound inches over the bar.</p>
  <p>Halesowen increased the lead on the half-hour when Haarhoff shielded a Richard Burgess cross from the right before laying off the ball for COWLEY to thump home from 8 yards. Codd was then alert to take out a 32nd cross from Cowley after he dispossessed Woolford on the right wing. Just before interval, Ian Cooper and Forsdick both fired in long range efforts on the visiting goal.</p>
  <p>Glasshoughton caused home hearts to flutter by pulling back a goal in the 49th minute when Richard DOBSON rose unchallenged to head home a free-kick from Constable. Four minutes later Pope recovered splendidly to block from substitute Dominic Blair in front of goal and on 56 minutes goalkeeper Taylor failed to collect a cross from Julian Wilkes but the home defence hacked clear.</p>
  <p>But it became crystal clear there would be no cup upset when BAKER restored the two-goal advantage on 58 minutes by nodding home a Forsdick cross from close range after Halesowen caught out the visitors with a quickly taken free-kick.</p>
  <p>Jason Moore then broke down the right and squared the ball for fellow substitute Ben STEANE to side-foot home the fourth goal in the 80th minute. Glasshoughton tired in the dying minutes and Codd saved from Forsdick in the clear in the 85th minute with Moore heading over the bar from just a few feet out. Haarhoff then flashed wide of the mark in the 86th minute following an excellent pass from Steane.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 4 Dunstable 4</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's certainly not dull at the moment is it? Another wildly entertaining match involving the mighty Yeltz occurred on Saturday when we drew 4-4 at home to Dunstable.</p>
  <p>By all accounts we played very well going forward but defended poorly (the score says that really). It was 3-3 at half-time, they took the lead with 8 minutes to go but we equalised in injury-time (again!) and they also had 2 players and probably two other staff sent off. Full Details in Dave's match report!</p>
  <p>All that means we still  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=09102004">lead the league</a> , although only on goal difference.</p>
  <p>On Saturday  <a href="http://glasshoughtonwelfare.tripod.com/">Glasshoughton Welfare</a>  are the visitors in the 3rd Qualifying Round of the FA Cup. They are from the Northern Counties East League, where they are mid-table but have several games in hand. We should take nothing for granted, but this is a pretty good draw at this stage and on current form we are strong favorites to go through.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: C. Taylor; Cooper, Haywood (Danks 90), Robinson (Moore 85), Pope, Jones, Cowley (Steane 60), Haarhoff, Moore, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Grocutt.</p>
  <p>Dunstable Town: P. Taylor; Childs, Turner, Strange, Kefford, Fontenelle (Barnett 80), Kean, Spring (Francis 58), Carney, Drew, Okai. Unused Subs: Mills, Pugh, Massie.</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Hamilton (Cheltenham) Attendance: 454 Bookings: Drew (26), Carney (27), Cowley (49) Sent Off: Drew (90), Carney (90)</p>
  <p>Halesowen preserved their long unbeaten run in a gripping eight goal draw with a late equaliser in a sensational injury time period that also saw undisciplined Dunstable having two players and two of the management team ordered off the pitch.</p>
  <p>Dunstable were the last team to beat Halesowen nine games earlier and the two fixtures between the sides have clocked up a remarkable 14 goals. Halesowen scored four excellent goals but were guilty of lax defending in a game that provided splendid entertainment for fans but could bring on nightmares for managers.</p>
  <p>But Dunstable had a bad start to the day when their coach failed to start and several players travelling by car managed to get lost en route to Halesowen resulting in a 30 minute delay to the kick-off.</p>
  <p>After the delayed start Karl Spring set the tone for an ill-tempered Dunstable afternoon by making a wild challenge on Ian Cooper in the 2nd minute. The visitors then drew first blood in the 5th minute when a long ball from Marc Kefford evaded defender Richard Robinson on his full debut and Carl DREW crashed the ball beyond goalkeeper Chris Taylor with Steve Pope's attempted clearance only helping the ball into the roof of the net.</p>
  <p>Cooper's 6th minute drive was saved by visiting goalkeeper Paul Taylor and a minute later Simon Forsdick clipped the ball past the goalkeeper but Matt Childs cleared for a corner. Lewis Baker then glanced wide in front of goal in the 8th minute.</p>
  <p>Alex COWLEY levelled the scores in the 13th minute after picking up Forsdick's cross and side-stepping the last defender to smash a goal of quality past helpless goalkeeper Paul Taylor from 12 yards. Jimmy Haarhoff was then put free in the 15th minute but his chip was easily gathered by the Dunstable 'keeper.</p>
  <p>Big, bustling Dunstable continued to knock the league leaders off their stride by exploiting the space down the left and in the 19th minute Drew back-heeled into the arms of goalkeeper Chris Taylor from Parys Okai's cross. Anthony FONTANELLE then regained the lead for Dunstable in the 20th minute by following up from 6 yards after Baker had initially cleared Drew's effort off the goal-line.</p>
  <p>In a flurry of goals before half-time, Halesowen first took the lead but then gave it away within a minute. COOPER levelled the scores with his first goal for Halesowen on 41 minutes by taking the ball around goalkeeper Paul Taylor and slotting home after being put clear by a defence-splitting pass from midfield by Richard Burgess. Dangerous Forsdick then went on a mazy run from midfield and squared the ball for BURGESS to smash the ball into the top corner from 10 yards in the 44th minute. Unbelievably, Dunstable then notched the sixth goal of a pulsating first half on 45 minutes when sloppy home defending allowed Drew to cross for FONTANELLE to convert from close range.</p>
  <p>The second half started in more subdued fashion with Halesowen going off the boil before the dramatic last ten-minute finale. Haarhoff's 46th minute shot along the ground was easily collected by Paul Taylor and Baker headed just wide from Dave Haywood's cross five minutes later. Dunstable forward Karl Spring collided with goalkeeper Chris Taylor in the 58th minute and was taken to hospital with three broken ribs.</p>
  <p>With the visitors still causing problems for Halesowen's shaky defence, home goalkeeper Chris Taylor produced two fine saves in the 62nd minute to keep the scores level. Taylor dived to his right to turn away the ball for a corner after a cross from Fontanelle skimmed the head of Carney and then made a point-blank save to keep out a header by substitute Anthony Francis from the resulting corner.</p>
  <p>Burgess and substitute Ben Steane both shot weakly at Paul Taylor before the explosive final ten minutes. Dunstable regained the lead yet again and looked to have claimed all three points in the 82nd minute through OKAI's clever close range back-heel flick from Drew's cross. Dunstable then caused danger again in the 88th minute when both Carney and Drew failed to convert a goal-line cross from Francis.</p>
  <p>The game exploded in nine minutes of added injury time with Halesowen playing four forwards to try to retrieve the situation. Drew was shown the red-card for dissent and was followed shortly afterwards by Carney for a tackle from behind. Breathtakingly, POPE salvaged a point for Halesowen by cracking home directly from the resulting 25-yard free-kick in the 95th minute. Dunstable found few friends in Halesowen in the final ugly moments with manager Darren Croft and his physio both being dismissed from the dug-out and it was several minutes after the game ended until calm was restored.</p>

    <h3>FAC 2Q  Gainsborough 2 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In one of the best games I've seen for ages, the mighty Yeltz clinched their place in the next round of the Cup with an injury-time winner from the brilliant Jimmy Haarhoff.</p>
  <p>They scored early on, but we equalised soon afterwards when Forsdick went on an excellent run, and Jimmy finished off with a great shot in the corner. We then played some of the best football I've seen us play for years and deservedly took the lead through a 25 yard top-corner screamer from Forsdick.</p>
  <p>Second half they came back into it and equalised with a pretty decent goal, but then Nick Preston fell nastily, and apparently swallowed his tounge. After being treated he walked off with assistance but later went to hospital with concussion. Hopefully everything is OK and I'm sure we all wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
  <p>The game carried on and at the end we were pretty happy with a draw, but then Jimmy broke down the left and smacked it into the bottom corner to send us home very happy.</p>
  <p>For those of you like me who haven't seen much of us recently, we are playing excellent entertaining (and winning!) football at the moment, so if you haven't been down The Grove for a while I strongly urge you to come back home - it's just like the old days!!</p>
  <p>Next Saturday we're back in league action at home when Dunstable are the visitors, and we try to gain revenge for our defeat down at their place a few weeks ago.</p>

    <h3>BSC  Yeltz 4 Banbury 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz continued their excellent form in the B'ham Senior Cup, keeping another clean sheet and scoring four at the other end to defeat Banbury. Goals from Steane, Cowley, Danks and Haarhoff means our winning run is now four wins on the trot with no goals conceded. Excellent stuff!</p>
  <p>More cup action on Saturday when we travel to  <a href="http://www.gainsboroughtrinity.com/">Gainsborough Trinity</a>  in the FA Cup 2nd Qualifying Round on Saturday. They're in the Conference North, but are down in 15th place so it should be a very interesting game in which we must have decent chances to progress.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Skidmore, Forsdick, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley (Danks 55), Haarhoff, Burgess (Cooper 66), Baker, Steane. Unused Subs: Haywood, Grocutt</p>
  <p>Banbury United: Tricker; Fuller, Blossom, Sullivan, Wallbridge, Tait, Stanbridge (O'Neill 76), McKay (Jackson HT), Forinton, Redknap, Potter (Brandish 35).</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Marriner (Sheldon)    Attendance: 197    Bookings: None</p>
  <p>Halesowen took a break from league action but over-powered Banbury by mixing their attractive, exciting football with a tremendous work-rate.</p>
  <p>The new league leaders looked confident from the start and were quickly on the attack with Richard Burgess winning a 2nd minute corner. Alex Cowley then shot through a crowded goalmouth in the 5th minute but the deflected ball took Nick Preston by surprise in front of an open goal. But Ben STEANE soon opened the scoring in the 6th minute by cracking home after the ball was played across goal.</p>
  <p>In continuous one-way traffic towards the Banbury goal, Steane delivered two 11th minute corners and a minute later Burgess flicked the ball over his head before hitting just wide from 6 yards out. Burgess then made a glaring miss from just two yards in front of an empty net after the lively Simon Forsdick collected a defence-splitting 18th minute pass from Jimmy Haarhoff to cross from the left. Little was seen of Banbury in the first period although home goalkeeper Chris Taylor recovered to save from Howard Forinton's chip on 22 minutes. Stuart Skidmore then won the ball in midfield in the 26th minute and he fed Haarhoff who side-stepped defenders Kieran Sullivan and Andrew Wallbridge but goalkeeper Simon Tricker turned away his low dribbling shot from the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>COWLEY increased the lead in the 28th minute with a brilliant finish after picking the ball up in midfield and charging forward to beat his defenders and hit home from 15 yards. Tricker then blocked from Haarhoff four minutes later.</p>
  <p>The second half proved to be a quieter affair and with Banbury working hard to try to get back into the game Forinton shot at Taylor on the hour. Preston then headed the ball into the path of Wayne Blossom but he struck wide after 71 minutes.</p>
  <p>Halesowen increased the tempo again in the final ten minutes with Sullivan's tackle denying Paul Danks on 83 minutes and Steane hitting a 20-yard free-kick over the bar a minute later before the Yeltz added two further late goals. Substitute DANKS converted a right-wing cross from Ian Cooper from close range for an 86th minute debut goal and HAARHOFF pressed the accelerator to outpace three defenders before firing past Tricker in the 87th minute.</p>
