    <h2><a href="/2004/09/25/TOP%20STUFF.html">TOP STUFF</a></h2>
    <h3>King's Lynn 0 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz are  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=25092004">top of the league</a>  after a hard fought victory away at King's Lynn. A very early goal from Burgess set us up nicely, but despite being on the defensive for much of the game we held out for the win. Chips and Ham surprisingly lost 5-0 at home to Histon which meant we went above them to lead the league.</p>
  <p>I'd just like to add what an excellent job Paul Holleran since he joined us at the end of last season. The difference in team spirit is clear, and is helped by having a settled squad rather than the constant comings and goings of Brendan's time.</p>
  <p>It's cup week again this week - first on Tuesday we host Banbury in the B'ham Senior Cup, before travelling to  <a href="http://www.gainsboroughtrinity.com/">Gainsborough Trinity</a>  in the FA Cup 2nd Qualifying Round on Saturday. They're in the Conference North, but are down in 15th place so it should be a very interesting game which we must have decent chances to progress.</p>
  <p>I must apologise for parts of the site not working properly at present. I'm once again struggling with poor quality hosting, but I'm on the case. I've found work arounds for most things now, so hopefully most things are useable for now.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Chris Taylor; Ian Cooper, David Haywood, Nicky Preston, Steven Pope, Dan Jones, Alex Cowley, Jason Moore, Richard Burgess, Lewis Baker, Simon Forsdick. Subs: Stuart Skidmore, Ben Steane, Asa Charlton, Jimmy Haarhoff</p>
  <p>Attendance: 802</p>
  <p>Halesowen hit the top of the table after grinding out an excellent win in Norfolk with a fine defensive performance and two great saves from experienced goalkeeper Chris Taylor.</p>
  <p>Richard Burgess notched the winning goal in only the second minute leaving the Yeltz to resolutely stick to a defensive task for 88 minutes against the manager-less Linnets to seal their third straight away win without conceding a goal.  Credit for the goal went to in-form Simon Forsdick who did the ground work by embarking on a mazy run from midfield before releasing the ball for BURGESS to steer the ball past goalkeeper Osbourne.</p>
  <p>Inevitably the home side, under caretaker manager former Wolves' striker Robert Taylor, created a lot of pressure in search of a first-half equaliser with Carl Holmes mis-directing a header wide and Danny Bloomfield twice going close.</p>
  <p>After the break Halesowen continued to look comfortable in defence with the Kings Lynn forwards becoming increasingly frustrated. The best chance for the hosts fell in the 57th minute when a header from Tony Battersby hit the inside of the post and Jack Defty looked certain to score, but Taylor smothered the ball. Taylor then also foiled Holmes and Defty late on in the game.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's late substitution saw the return of Jimmy Haarhoff from injury and he injected some extra pace into the visiting attack. Haarhoff almost made it 2-0 on 82 minutes but he shot weakly at the goalkeeper instead of squaring the ball to the unmarked Jason Moore and Halesowen held out through an extended period of injury-time to record their first ever win at the Walks.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2004/09/18/FIVE%20AGAIN.html">FIVE AGAIN</a></h2>
    <h3>FAC  Borrowash 0 Yeltz 5</h3>

    <p>
  <p>For the second away game running the mighty Yeltz won 5-0 - although against lower-league opposition this is not quite as impressive it's still a very good start to our cup campaign.</p>
  <p>We now meet Gainsborough Trinity of the Conference North in the next qualifying round. They've started modestly just below half-way so it should be an interesting tie.</p>
  <p>Next game is on Saturday when we make the long trip to King's Lynn.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Borrowash Victoria: Wood; Bedford, Campbell (Freeman 51), McGinty, Barnes, Rigley, Baum, Sykes, Carson, Dan-Bereh (Johnson HT), Tansley (Banks 61). Unused Subs: Swannick, Flinders.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Haywood (Steane 39), Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley (Skidmore 66), Moore, Burgess, Baker, Forsdick (Charlton 57). Unused Sub: Danks, Grocutt.</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Jones (Mansfield)     Attendance: 155     Bookings: None</p>
  <p>There was never any sign of a Cup upset as Halesowen exposed the gulf between the leagues to hand out their second successive 5-0 thrashing away from home.</p>
  <p>Borrowash's neat set-up and the massive potential of the Robinson Construction Bowl is a credit to the hard-work of the friendly Borrowash officials but sadly the poor Northern Counties East Premier players provided little competition for the Yeltz.</p>
  <p>A 3rd minute cross from Alex Cowley dipped just over the bar and a minute later Cowley was crowded out from Jason Moore's cross.</p>
  <p>Cowley set Halesowen on their way with his first goal of the season on 15 minutes after Simon Forsdick robbed Mark Barnes on the edge of the penalty area and found Moore before COWLEY took his time to strike home through a crowd of defenders from 10 yards. Two minutes later Moore was brought down in the penalty area and Steve POPE slammed home from the penalty spot despite goalkeeper Paul Wood getting both hands to the ball.</p>
  <p>Comforted by the two-goal lead, the Yeltz threatened to run riot and Forsdick played a great pass out of midfield on 22 minutes to put Richard Burgess clear but Wood saved for a corner. Moore then found himself clear on goal in the 29th minute but made a hash of his first touch and Wood collected easily.</p>
  <p>The visitors then sat back on their lead towards half-time allowing Borrowash to come more into the game. Zakie Dan-Bereh missed a golden chance in the 40th minute when last defender Pope tripped over the ball to leave the striker completely free in space with just goalkeeper Chris Taylor to beat but he hesitated too long and Taylor saved with the help of defender Dan Jones.</p>
  <p>Halesowen wrapped up the game with a further two goals early in the second half. On 47 minutes Ian Cooper fed Forsdick and although Wood saved, BURGESS hit home the loose ball from close range. Burgess then struck the post after being fed by substitute Ben Steane down the right but MOORE was on hand to tap home the rebound in the 51st minute.</p>
  <p>Adam Baum struck a 25-yard free-kick over the bar on 57 minutes for the hosts and on the hour a 20-yard drive from Burgess was saved by busy Wood at the other end. Phil Carson shot weakly at Taylor from a good position on 68 minutes but Steane cut in to force Wood to save from 10-yards a minute later.</p>
  <p>BURGESS added a fifth Halesowen goal in the 74th minute with a 15-yard shot from the right that found the net off the square left-hand upright.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Grantham 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Saw that excellent headine on the Southern league website and couldn't resist using it - especially as spirits are very high now we're  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=11092004"&gt;up to second</a>  after a late winner by Lewis earned all three points against Grantham. See  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=11092004#DJ"&gt;Dave's match report</a>  for full details.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we start our FA Cup campaign away at  <a href="http://www.borrowashvictoria.co.uk/"&gt;Borrowash Victoria</a> , a Northern Counties East Premier team based near Derby. They've only one point from their first five games, so hopefully we can get through (which is important given the prize money available in the competition).</p>
  <p>I'm still on my travels - with most of the Jolly Boys at Poolio's wedding in Ireland - so updates to the site will still be patchy until after the weekend I'm afraid.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper (Skidmore 84), Haywood, Preston, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Moore (Steane 62), Burgess, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Danks, Grocutt.</p>
  <p>Grantham Town: Zaccardi; Wooding, Hallows, Francis, Reddington, Robinson, Darby, Clifford (McGowan 87), Collins, Huckerby (Commons 66), Smith (Connell 66). Unused Subs: Sutton, Standage</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Allon (Wigan) Attendance: 428 Bookings: Francis (40)</p>
  <p>High-flying Halesowen moved back into second-place in the table with Lewis Baker's late goal breaking the resistance of mid-table Grantham who have now lost on their last 8 visits to the Grove.</p>
  <p>After the excitement of previous home games the miserly Grantham central defensive partnership of Stuart Reddington and Dave Robinson proved difficult to break down.</p>
  <p>Alex Cowley made an exciting run down the right-wing from his own half in the 7th minute but the Grantham defence cleared. Clever play from Simon Forsdick then let in Jason Moore and although his effort was blocked, Dave Haywood flashed an 18-yard shot just wide. Grantham then went close on 14 minutes when a cross from veteran forward Darren Collins fell for Scott Huckerby in space, but the out-of-form forward blasted high from 15 yards. A Dan Jones header then let in Collins on 22 minutes but Jones made a fine retrieving tackle on the edge of his own penalty area. Halesowen remained generally on top and a 32nd minute half-volley from Richard Burgess was caught by visiting goalkeeper Mario Ziccardi.</p>
  <p>Grantham enjoyed a good spell before the interval with a 35th minute free-kick from Brett Darby drifting over goalkeeper Chris Taylor before bouncing back off the far post. Darby followed up to deliver another left-wing cross and Fabien Smith bundled the ball home over Taylor but the effort was disallowed for a push by Robinson.</p>
  <p>After an excellent week for the Yeltz, a disappointing crowd of only 428 saw the visitors continue to close down the Yeltz in the second half although Forsdick met a 55th minute Cowley cross with a fierce volley and Ziccardi pushed the ball away for a corner. At the other end, Taylor collected a 57th minute header from Reddington and two minutes later a Darby cross was hooked goal-bound by Collins with Taylor producing a fine reflex save. Steve Pope headed a deep 68th minute cross from Jones wide and on 70 minutes substitute Darren Connell met a Dominic Hallows cross with Taylor again saving for a corner.</p>
  <p>Substitute Ben Steane found the net for Halesowen on 71 minutes but the referee disallowed his strike for a previous foul in a goalmouth scramble. Burgess just failed to capitalise on a 76th minute mistake from Ziccardi and in the 80th minute Haywood broke free from defence but his shot was deflected away. Taylor made another good save to deny Collins in the 82nd minute from a good through ball from Darby and Reddington nodded a corner wide a minute later.</p>
  <p>BAKER finally cooked up a late winner to break the Gingerbreads in the 87th minute by hitting home from 12 yards when Burgess found space on the right and pulled the ball back into his path.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 Chippenham 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Well things certainly aren't dull at the moment. In another fantasticly exciting game we came back from being two behind twice to earn a point with a very late equaliser. Full details of a classic match in  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=07092004">Dave's match report</a> .</p>
  <p>We're now  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=07092004">3rd in the table</a>  and well in touch in what looks like is going to be an eventful season. Let's hope we can continue our good form against Grantham at The Grove on Saturday.</p>
  <p>I'm still on holiday, so updates to the site will continue to be sporadic I'm afraid.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper (Preston 84), Haywood, Jones, Pope, Charlton, Cowley, Burgess, Haarhoff (Steane 36), Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Danks, Grocutt.</p>
  <p>Chippenham Town: Hervin; Regis, W. Thorne, G. Thorne, Herring, McEntegart, Wilmot (Davidson 90), Horgan, Paul (Allison 63), Constable, Walker. Unused Subs: Charity, Kirk, Astley.</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Dawes (Willenhall) Attendance: 541 Bookings: G. Thorne (9), Davidson (90)</p>
  <p>Gutsy Halesowen fought back from a two-goal half-time deficit to rescue a point in the 98th minute of an incredible six-goal thriller against table-topping Chippenham.</p>
  <p>The hosts gave themselves an uphill battle by falling behind in the 2nd minute when their defence failed to pick up captain GARY THORNE as he flashed a header from Ellis Wilmot's corner beyond goalkeeper Chris Taylor. Chippenham goalkeeper Mark Hervin dealt with a 5th minute cross from Alex Cowley and collected a Dave Haywood free-kick two minutes later but James Constable then screwed wide from ten yards at the other end.</p>
  <p>Speedy Jimmy Haarhoff caused terrible trouble for the visiting defence and played a delicate through ball for Simon Forsdick on 17 minutes but Hervin raced off his line to clear with Steve Pope's diving header falling just wide from Haywood's resulting corner. In exciting end-to-end play, home goalkeeper Taylor raced out to clear on 22 minutes and Scott Walker nodded a right-wing cross wide seven minutes later.</p>
  <p>Haarhoff took his usual share of punishing challenges up front but brilliantly deceived his marker on the half-hour to allow the ball to run onto Lewis Baker who then had a penalty appeal denied. Asa Charlton blasted a 32nd minute free-kick wide from 25 yards and on 35 minutes Forsdick side-stepped his marker but Ian Herring made a fine challenge to block the shot.</p>
  <p>Haarhoff was forced to limp out of the game in the 36th minute and all hope looked lost for the Yeltz when they were caught out by a second goal for the Bluebirds in the 42nd minute as WILMOT found space to latch onto a long ball and beat Taylor from 15 yards. A minute before the interval Martin Paul picked up a bad pass from Pope to drive wide.</p>
  <p>Halesowen clawed their way back into the game with a spirited second-half display and in the 50th minute Baker headed a Haywood corner into the path of Forsdick but his brilliant volley rebounded off the left-hand post. But FORSDICK then provided an important life-line when he rounded goalkeeper Hervin and slotted home from a narrow angle following a defence-splitting pass from substitute Ben Steane in the 55th minute. Pope then headed another well-delivered free-kick from Haywood just wide but it was home goalkeeper Taylor who made a fine reflex save to deny Martin Paul from Constable's cross on the hour.</p>
  <p>Chippenham seemed to have made the game safe in the 62nd minute when Herring's throw-in was prodded home by CONSTABLE from close range. But as the fast and furious action continued, Ian Cooper sprayed a long pass across to Haywood and he trapped the ball before delivering a deep cross for FORSDICK to head home at the far post in the 66th minute. Baker made Chippenham look vulnerable again when he stole in to head Haywood's free-kick wide three minutes later.</p>
  <p>With five minutes remaining, Cowley delivered a troublesome cross into the Chippenham area and in a massive skirmish Hervin made a tremendous save from Baker's overhead kick before Forsdick hit the net on the half-volley although the referee had already blown for a foul on Gary Thorne by Richard Burgess. In the 89th minute Taylor was alert to dive and save at the feet of Constable.</p>
  <p>Amazingly, with 98 minutes showing on the clock, Pope still had time to launch one more long ball forward and the ball fell invitingly to substitute Nick Preston near the penalty spot and he calmly tucked the ball into the top corner to earn a jubilant point.</p>

    <h3>Cirencester 0 Yeltz 5</h3>

    <p>
  <p>You just don't know what to expect at present. In a complete surprise, the truly mighty Yeltz beat top-of-the-table rivals Cirencester 5-0 away from home on Saturday. A fantastic hat-trick from Jimmy plus others from Asa and the Pope means we moved ahead of Cirencester into second place.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday we host league leaders Chips and Ham at The Grove. They've had an excellent start so far, but if we can play anything like we did on Saturday we must have an excellent chance.</p>
  <p>The FA Cup draw has been made, so in the 1st Qualifying Round in a couple of weeks we visit  <a href="http://www.worldfootball.org/club.php/country/ENG/club/1000004664">Borrowash Victoria</a> . They're in the Northern Counties East and are based near Derby.</p>
  <p>As you've probably noticed the site is being updated intermittently at present as I'm on my holidays for two weeks, so apologies for that but I'm doing my best!</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Cirencester Town: Thompson; Arndale, Halliday, Jackson, Mayo, Wotton, Robison, Wimble (McCabe 57), Hopkins (Stanley 66), Griffin, Davis (Fitch 57). Unused Subs: Bird, Bevan</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Cooper, Forsdick, Jones, Pope, Charlton, Cowley, Burgess (Grocutt 79), Haarhoff, Baker (Steane 68), Strachan (Preston 70). Unused Sub: Danks</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Hamilton (Cheltenham) Attendance: 284 Bookings: Charlton (27), Griffin (74), Pope (75), Robison (75)</p>
  <p>Jimmy Haarhoff was Halesowen's hat-trick hero in a stunning five-star performance against previously unbeaten Cirencester.</p>
  <p>The victory lifted Halesowen into second place in a game that proved to be much easier than Halesowen could possibly have expected against an uncharacteristically out-of-sorts Cirencester.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz made the perfect start after 75 seconds when Darren Robison was judged to have handled the ball and captain Asa CHARLTON slammed home from the penalty spot. In further early pressure, Lewis Baker was thwarted when he snatched at a shot and the ball spun wide for a corner off the legs of goalkeeper Paul Thompson.</p>
  <p>Baker then headed clear a 20th minute corner from Shaun Wimble and two minutes later Wimble was denied in a desperate goal-line clearance with Steve Pope tidying up. Haarhoff weaved his way through the home defence on 24 minutes but his shot was eventually crowded out and four minutes later Richard Burgess turned on the edge of the area with Thompson beating away the ball for a corner. Halesowen went two goals ahead from the 28th minute corner kick by Simon Forsdick when goalkeeper Thompson failed to collect the ball under pressure from Pope and HAARHOFF brilliantly volleyed home the rebound from ten yards.</p>
  <p>The Centurions enjoyed a better spell before the interval with Dan Jones recovering to make a saving tackle on Scott Griffin on the half-hour and a minute later experienced visiting goalkeeper Chris Taylor saved Griffin's shot from the left. A 33rd minute corner was just too high for the head of Robison and a minute before the break Michael Jackson ran through the centre but shot weakly wide.</p>
  <p>In a heartening gesture from the home side several of the faithful following fans were allowed into the Corinium Stadium for free after being severely delayed by an accident near home on the M5.</p>
  <p>Halesowen added a third goal to kill the game as a meaningful contest seven minutes into the second period when the alert HAARHOFF caught out the home defence to clinically beat Thompson from a narrow angle after latching onto a left-wing throw-in that Arndale failed to meet.</p>
  <p>The increasingly confident Yeltz capitalised on casual defending to increase the lead in the 65th minute when Burgess headed on a left-wing corner from Cowley and POPE hit the roof of the net from close range.</p>
  <p>Baker handled the ball on the edge of his own area in the 67th minute but Jackson hit the free-kick a foot over Taylor's bar and five minutes later Taylor made a fine reflex save to deny substitute Ben Fitch when visiting substitute Nicky Preston was slow to clear.</p>
  <p>Haarhoff completed his fine hat-trick in the 84th minute when Forsdick's left-wing corner was pulled back by substitute Darren Grocutt and although HAARHOFF's shot was saved by Thompson, the livewire hat-trick hero followed up to hit the net from close range.</p>
  <p>Halesowen could have added further goals in the final five minutes against the demoralised home defence. Cowley struck the side-netting with Thompson off his line on 85 minutes and a minute later Thompson tipped away a shot from substitute Ben Steane for a corner. In injury time Haarhoff combined with Cowley on the break with Haarhoff finally squaring the ball to Cowley in the penalty area, but Cowley waited too long and his effort was blocked.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 Tiverton 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After this disappointment of the weekend, the mighty Yeltz once again put in an excellent home performance in beating Tiverton 3-1 at The Grove. Early goals from Strachan and Burgess put us in control, and although they got one back we clinched all three points with a third from Lewis. More details as usual in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>We're now back up to third in the table, and interestingly enough we're playing the two teams currently above us in our next two games. On Saturday we travel down to Cirencester, who despite finishing above us last year we managed to lose to us twice. Then next Tuesday our friends from Chips and Ham bring will be bring their usual hundreds of fans up to The Grove (don't worry it won't be all-ticket).</p>
  <p>I'm off with several of the other Jolly Boys on Poolio's stag weekend this weekend, so updates to the site may be even slower than usual I'm afraid.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Taylor; Strachan, Haywood (Cooper 62), Jones, Pope, Charlton, Cowley, Burgess, Haarhoff, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Steane, Grocutt, Preston, Danks.</p>
  <p>Tiverton Town: Ovendale; Winter, Vinnicombe, Hallett (Lock 65), Milsom, Cousins, Wills, Harvey, Stocco, Steele (Densham 83), Mudge. Unused Subs: Edwards, Booth, Gough</p>
  <p>Referee: S. Cook (Lydney, Glos.) Attendance: 458 Bookings: Jones (57), Forsdick (68)</p>
  <p>Halesowen returned to winning ways at the Grove and stunned impressive Tiverton with two goals in the first eight minutes of a thrilling encounter.</p>
  <p>Craig STRACHAN made it an ideal start in the 3rd minute when he was allowed to run into the penalty area with the defence backing off and floated the ball over goalkeeper Mark Ovendale into the top corner of the net. Shell-shocked Tiverton fell two goals behind in the 8th minute when Strachan then delivered a deep right-wing cross and Richard BURGESS was lurking unmarked at the far post to strike home from close range.</p>
  <p>With the visitors eventually settling, the talented Jamie Mudge picked up a clearance from a right-wing free-kick but home goalkeeper Chris Taylor made an excellent 21st minute save at the foot of the post on his debut. Taylor then punched a deep right-wing cross clear and saved at the feet of David Steele on 32 minutes after more good work by Mudge.</p>
  <p>MUDGE deservedly pulled a goal back for the visitors in the 37th minute with a fine strike into the bottom corner from the edge of the area after the ball was worked into his path from the left-wing.</p>
  <p>Tom Stocco then hit high over the bar from Steve Winter's free-kick but a minute before the interval Dave Haywood's corner flashed across the face of the Tiverton goal after Ovendale failed to gather.</p>
  <p>Tiverton were caught cold again at the start of the second-half when Strachan won a right-wing corner and Lewis BAKER rose to powerfully head home Haywood's 48th minute corner.</p>
  <p>With the visitors continuing to look lively Taylor pushed the ball over the bar from Winter's 20-yard free-kick on the hour. Baker hit a fierce overhead kick over the bar in the 65th minute but Taylor was on hand to collect a 71st minute effort from Iain Harvey and then juggled a corner from Chris Vinnicombe four minutes later. Jimmy Haarhoff worked hard up front for Halesowen and did well on the break in the 76th minute to set up substitute Ian Cooper but his shot was blocked.</p>
  <p>The referee awarded Tiverton an 81st minute free-kick just ten yards from goal when he spotted Taylor collecting a back-pass from Asa Charlton but Mudge's shot was turned away for a corner as Halesowen continued to contain the attacking threat.</p>

    <h3>Dunstable 4 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After our pretty good start we headed to Dunstable with high hopes, but unfortunately we put in a poor display away from home for the second week running.</p>
  <p>We were 3-1 down at half-time despite Steve Pope equalising their early goal, and then when Richard Burgess scored his first for the club it looked like we might have a chance. However they scored once again and we came away with nothing.</p>
  <p>We've slipped back to  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=28082004">6th in the table</a>  but still only 4 points of the top despite letting in 7 goals in our last two away games.</p>
  <p>We're back at Fortress Grove on Monday, when Tiverton are the visitors. They've started reasonably well, but let's hope we can get back to winning ways to continue to stay in touch at the top.</p>

  <p>Referee: M. Darlow (Cambridge) Attendance: 160 Bookings: Kefford (38), Spring (56), Skidmore (56), Fontenelle (60), Baker (60). Sent Off: Charlton (90)</p>
  <p>Halesowen were their own worst enemy as their away-day blues continued as a result of some sloppy defending. Mark Sheils suffered an indecisive and torrid afternoon in goal for Halesowen but was given no help by his shaky defence.</p>
  <p>With the visitors were slow off the mark, it took Dunstable just four minutes to take the lead when Karl SPRING outpaced Nick Preston down the centre and slammed the ball past Sheils from 12 yards. A 9th minute cross from Anthony Fontenelle then fell just wide and Grant Carney flicked a header just wide on 16 minutes after beating Preston in the air.</p>
  <p>Halesowen equalised with their first attack on 24 minutes when the referee pulled back play after Jason Moore's shot was blocked by the legs of home goalkeeper Paul Taylor and Steve POPE cracked home the resulting 20-yard free-kick low into the bottom corner.</p>
  <p>But the Yeltz failed to seize the initiative and the hosts were allowed to regain the lead within a minute when Sheils slipped and flapped at a right-wing corner allowing SPRING to scoop the ball into the roof of the net from 8 yards out. A 29th minute lob from Richard Burgess was then cleared off the line by home defender Marc Kefford.</p>
  <p>Dunstable increased their lead in the 35th minute with another simple goal when Rob Kean slotted the ball through for CARNEY to lift the ball over Sheils from six yards out.</p>
  <p>BURGESS gave Halesowen brief hope by notching his first goal for the club five minutes into the second half as he finished well from 20-yards after shrugging off his defender. In a better spell for the visitors Lewis Baker struck just wide three minutes later from an Alex Cowley cross and Dunstable's Ryan Frater smashed the ball off his own defender into the side-netting on the hour. However, the start of the second half was marred by series of scuffles and niggly fouls resulting in four bookings.</p>
  <p>The home side added their fourth goal in the 74th minute with Halesowen's defence all at sea again when CARNEY looped a header over the head of Sheils from Dean Walker's right-wing cross.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Banbury 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Back at home the mighty Yeltz got back to winning ways against early strugglers Banbury United. Second-half goals from Steve Pope and Jason has taken us back up to third in the table, just a point behind the leaders. Most satisfactory.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we visit Dunstable for what I think is our first visit, before Tiverton visit The Grove on Bank Holiday Monday.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Charlton, Cowley, Moore (Jones 83), Haarhoff (Burgess 73), Forsdick (Steane 85), Skidmore. Unused Sub: Grocutt</p>
  <p>Banbury United: Tricker; Fuller, Jackson (McKay 82), Sullivan, Allen, Eldridge, Stanbridge, Blossom, Forinton, Redknap, Potter. Unused Subs: O'Neill, Essex, Pond.</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Williams (Hereford) Attendance: 401 Bookings: Forinton (61), Potter (62), Sullivan (77), Eldridge (78)</p>
  <p>Halesowen kept up the pace near the top of the table and moved back into third place with their third win in four games.</p>
  <p>In a disappointing first half Banbury's George Redknap headed a 30-yard free-kick from Paul Eldridge wide in the 9th minute. Halesowen's Simon Forsdick then put Jason Moore clear but he selflessly tried to cross the ball back into Alex Cowley and the danger was cleared for a corner. Dave Haywood's 16th minute cross was then flicked past the post by a Moore header. Halesowen forced two more corners in the 27th and 28th minutes after hard-work from Jimmy Haarhoff but at the other end Nicky Preston headed clear when a Cowley clearance was deflected towards goal.</p>
  <p>Mark Sheils produced a tremendous reflex save to keep out the best chance of the first-half from former Birmingham City forward Howard Forinton's header on 32 minutes when a goal seemed certain.</p>
  <p>A 34th minute corner from Cowley was scrambled clear and Haarhoff then almost converted a 40th minute cross from Haywood. At the start of the second period Asa Charlton cleared the danger when Wayne Blossom challenged Sheils outside his area.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally took the lead in the 51st minute with Steve POPE heading home a right-wing corner from Haywood. Cowley's 25-yard drive was then collected by visiting goalkeeper Simon Tricker two minutes later. With the second period still proving low-key, Sheils dived to save Pope's 63rd minute back-header and Haywood cleared off the goal-line on 74 minutes after Sheils failed to gather a cross.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz livened up in the latter stages and Jason MOORE claimed his 50th goal for Halesowen after 77 minutes when he latched onto a long ball and beat his marker before powering home from 15 yards to leave goalkeeper Tricker rooted to the spot. Cowley then cut in from the right to force Tricker into a 79th minute save and Moore headed against the bar on 80 minutes with Tricker gathering the rebound from Forsdick.</p>

    <h3>Histon 3 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It was never going to last, but our unbeaten run came to an end in a battling but ultimately pointless defeat at Histon.</p>
  <p>The were big and well-organised, difficult to break down and they took their chances very well. They took the lead in the first-half, although we were unlucky not to be level with their keeper making a fantastic save from Jimmy and Jason missing from close range at the far post.</p>
  <p>When they scored a pretty good second goal early in the second half it looked all over, but we got one back through an excellent Asa free kick but couldn't find the equaliser and they clinched it in the last minute with a third.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday  <a href="http://www.banburyunited.co.uk/">Banbury</a>  visit The Grove in another league game. They just got one point so far, so if we can keep up our current good form I'd hope we can get three more points.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Histon: Barber; Haniver, Farrington, Hipperson, Vowden, A. Cambridge, Nightingale, Andrews, Kennedy, I. Cambridge, Barker. Subs: Munns, Abbs, Goddard, Beck, Coburn.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Cooper, Haywood (Burgess 72), Preston, Pope, Charlton, Cowley, Moore, Haarhoff, Baker (Skidmore 23), Steane (Forsdick 65). Unused Subs: Jones, Strachan.</p>
  <p>Attendance: 371</p>
  <p>Halesowen tasted defeat for the first time this season and were second-best for much of the afternoon against the strong runners-up from last season's Eastern Division.</p>
  <p>Lively Histon boast an impressive recent record with several players and the management team showing evidence of past links to neighbours Cambridge City.</p>
  <p>Haniver missed an early open goal after just 30 seconds for the hosts and on 14 minutes Ian Cambridge's shot struck a visiting defender. Jimmy Haarhoff then saw his shot parried onto the Histon post by goalkeeper Paul Barber. The home side took the lead on 31 minutes when Halesowen's defence fail to clear as Neil Kennedy cushioned a header for Neil ANDREWS to smash home low-down past Mark Sheils. Just before the break, Jason Moore headed a good chance into the side-netting.</p>
  <p>In one-way traffic, IAN CAMBRIDGE increased the lead by racing free on 61 minutes and he cut into the box beating Steve Pope to place the ball skilfully past Sheils. Asa CHARLTON reduced the deficit by curling home directly from a 71st minute free-kick.</p>
  <p>Despite some late Yeltz pressure Histon deservedly added a third in injury time through KENNEDY who was set up by Peter Munns.</p>

    <h3>Hednesford 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's obviously very early days, but we've made a fantastic start to the season!</p>
  <p>A second victory tonight against old rivals Hednesford has taken us to the  <a href="/anorak/table.aspx?date=16082004">top of the table</a> . Goals from Jimmy Haarhoff and Dave Haywood gave us our best start since our promotion season of 1989-90 (according to Chas)</p>
  <p>On Saturday we visit Histon with high hopes of continuing our good run of form. They lost at Cirencester on Saturday, although it's still early days to try to make too many predictions on how good teams are. However, let's hope for another good performance and some more points.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Hednesford Town: Young; Gibson (Antrobus 77), Beckett, Barrow, Teesdale, Williams (McGhee 20), Gray, Palmer (Brindley 83), Charie, McSweeney, Berks. Unused Subs: Adams, Evans</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Jones, Charlton, Cowley, Moore, Haarhoff (Grocutt 81), Baker (Forsdick 84), Steane (Skidmore 60). Unused Subs: Burgess, Strachan</p>

Booked: Baker (65), Gray (65), Preston (66), McGhee (66), Jones (67)&#xD;
Attendance: 644</p>
  <p>The Mighty Yeltz moved to the top of the Southern Premier League table with a second win in three days giving them their best start to a new season for 15 years. Dave Haywood capped a fine individual performance to hit a 75th minute winner against the FA Trophy holders Hednesford with Halesowen once again displaying their newly-found tremendous team spirit.</p>
  <p>Jimmy HAARHOFF gave Halesowen an 18th minute lead when his low shot beat Ryan Young from an Alex Cowley chip into the box.</p>
  <p>The Pitmen forced two corners midway in the first-half and Chris Gray then headed a David Berks header over the bar. On 37 minutes Haywood won a left-wing corner for Halesowen and a minute later Jason Moore's shot was deflected away for another corner kick. The hosts went close two minutes before the interval when Leon McSweeney broke clear but Mark Sheils turned his shot around the post.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen increasingly on the back-foot at the start of the second-half, McSweeney drove wide of the post on 53 minutes. Hednesford equalised in the 59th minute when Damien Charie beat the offside trap and although he was forced wide down the left, his cross was spilled by Sheils to give McSWEENEY the simple task of tapping home on the goal-line. A string of bookings then followed just after the hour as the game became increasingly competitive in nature.</p>
  <p>But the visitors failed to buckle under pressure and fought back to regain the lead in the 75th minute when HAYWOOD hit a free-kick directly into the net from the right-wing, although the ball appeared to make contact with home defender Lee Barrow on its journey into the net. Halesowen held onto the lead relatively easily and on 80 minutes Haarhoff fought hard to win a left-wing corner.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 3 Aylesbury 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>It's good to be back to real action, and also good to start off with a win. Goals from Jason (2) and Steve Pope means it was our best first day result since we beat Gresley 3-0 a few seasons ago. More details in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>Some interesting results in other games - Chips and Ham won 6-0 and King's Lynn and Solihull both scored 5. It's going to take a while to figure out the relative strengths of the different teams, but it wasn't a good start for a few teams (including Team Bath - hurrah!)</p>
  <p>Our opponents in next week's games both lost today as well. On Monday we visit long time opponents  <b>Hednesford</b> , before on Saturday we make what I think is our first visit to  <b>Histon</b> . Let's hope our good form continues and we can make a decent start to the season for once!</p>

  <p>The Yeltz were given a standing ovation after an exciting display in their first game of the new season brought a comfortable victory in the first league meeting against former Ryman League Aylesbury United.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz started confidently and won a first minute corner after visiting goalkeeper Jack Rashid flapped at the ball. Last season's leading goal-scorer Jason MOORE made it a perfect start for Halesowen with an 8th minute opening goal when he beat the offside-trap and side-stepped goalkeeper Rashid before placing a pin-point chip beyond the final two defenders into the top corner from the edge of the area. Alex Cowley then skipped free down the right to win a 21st minute corner and a 25th minute cross from Cowley was cleared off the toe of Jimmy Haarhoff.</p>
  <p>In a better spell for the Ducks, Paul Lamb tamely side-footed a good chance past the post in the 27th minute and Dean Cracknell lobbed over the bar three minutes later. Halesowen's Haarhoff cut in from the left in the 32nd minute but his shot rebounded off the left-hand post into the arms of goalkeeper Rashid. The lively Meshach Cole then beat Yeltz central defender Nicky Preston for pace down the right but shot straight at goalkeeper Mark Sheils in the 38th minute instead of crossing to the unmarked Danny Mead. Sheils had a confident afternoon and collected a number of Aylesbury crosses and corners cleanly.</p>
  <p>With the hosts searching for more goals, Lewis Baker was unfortunate to see his header rebound clear off the underside of the bar in the 41st minute from Cowley's cross. On the stroke of half-time Dave Haywood's corner crept through to Baker and then onto Steve Pope but Mead managed to clear off the line.</p>
  <p>After a quiet opening few minutes to the second period, Haarhoff battled to win the ball in the 53rd minute and linked up with Ben Steane to set up Moore to swivel and fire at Rashid from 10 yards. Haywood then blasted a 25-yard free-kick at Rashid three minutes later.</p>
  <p>Halesowen wrapped up the points with two goals in four minutes with Aylesbury's defence looking shaky under the pacy onslaught. POPE smashed home into the roof of the net on 60 minutes from 8 yards after Aylesbury failed to clear a free-kick from the right. MOORE then hit his second in the 64th minute by latching onto a long ball forward from Pope and beat goalkeeper Rashid to the ball before rolling the ball past the final defender and into an empty net. With Aylesbury under continued pressure, Haarhoff was just wide with a 69th minute diving header and Baker's 75th minute overhead kick fell inches wide of the left-hand post. Substitute Richard Burgess then set up Haarhoff to burst clear in the 80th minute but Rashid made a fine blocking save.</p>
  <p>Aylesbury notched an injury-time consolation goal with virtually the last kick of the game when Paul EDGEWORTH cut through the centre of Halesowen's defence and hit into the corner of the net from 20 yards.</p>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz go into the start of the new season on the back of some promising pre-season performances, and two wins against lower-league opposition.</p>
  <p>On Thursday we beat Chasetown 2-1, before putting six past Boldmere on Saturday in an excellent finish to the summer preliminaries. More details in the various match reports.</p>
  <p>We kick off the new league season with the visit of  <a href="http://www.aylesburyunited.co.uk/">Aylesbury</a>  to The Grove on Saturday. They finished tailed off at the bottom of the Ryman Premier last year, but as with several teams this year it's going to be hard to judge how well we're going to do. However we must be pretty confident we can start off with three points.</p>
  <p>For all those who are still playing, don't forget this is the first game of the new Fantasy Island so don't forget to enter your predictions before the kickoff - there are no excuses!</p>

    <h3>Friendly  Yeltz 1 Bromsgrove 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Just two weeks to go now, and another friendly passes with a 1-1 draw against Bromsgrove - our goal was an early strike from Jason. Full details in  <a href="/news/matchreports.asp?date=31072004">Dave's match report</a> .</p>
  <p>The last two games before the season proper are this week, away at Chasetown on Thursday and then at Boldmere on Saturday.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Cooper, Haywood, Preston, Pope, Charlton, Cowley, Moore, Burgess, Baker, Strachan. Used Subs: Jones, Haarhoff, Forsdick, Skidmore, Steane, Williams (GK)</p>
  <p>Bromsgrove Rovers: Lowe; Benbow, Hillman, Douglin, Benton, Mahon, Daniels, Erraji, Bellingham, Appleton, Lennon. Subs: Frost, Hateley (GK), Palmer, McGrath, Churchill, Gandy (GK)</p>
  <p>Referee: W. Barrett (Cradley) Attendance: 230</p>
  <p>Bromsgrove started brightly in a keenly contested friendly with Mark Benbow heading a John Daniels corner just over the bar in the 4th minute. Mark Bellingham was brought down on the edge of the penalty area in the 5th minute and home goalkeeper Mark Sheils gathered a 10th minute strike from Ryan Mahon.</p>
  <p>Halesowen took an 8th minute lead when Jason MOORE gratefully accepted a bad pass out of defence in the Bromsgrove area and eventually beat former Yeltz goalkeeper Matt Lowe from 6 yards out. Alex Cowley continued to look exciting on the ball and won the first of two corners in the 38th minute after winning the ball in midfield and surging forward. Two minutes after half-time Cowley's right-wing cross clipped the top of the crossbar and Cowley then struck wide on 51 minutes following a neat interchange with Moore.</p>
  <p>The visitors levelled the scores in the 52nd minute with BELLINGHAM converting a cross at the far post after Danny Lennon broke free on the left. Visiting goalkeeper Lowe dived to save at the feet of Cowley on 66 minutes before saving from Jimmy Haarhoff three minutes later and Dave Haywood drove across goal in the 70th minute.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz applied further pressure late on in the game but were unable to break down Joe Jackson's well-organised Bromsgrove, who must surely start as firm favourites to capture the Southern League Division One West championship.</p>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz continued our promising pre-season build up with a 1-1 draw against Walsall. We took the lead in the first half through Alex Cowley, although the break came early when Walsall walked off in a huff after some tough tackling from Lewis Baker. They equalised after the teams came back out, but all in all it sounds like another excellent performance.</p>
  <p>Only two weeks to go before the start of the season proper, and we continue our preparations against Bromsgrove on Saturday at The Grove.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Cooper, Forsdick, Charlton, Pope, Jones, Cowley, Moore, Haarhoff, Baker, Steane. Used Subs: Preston, Haywood, Skidmore, Colwell, Burgess, R. Williams(GK)</p>
  <p>Walsall: Coleman; Platt, L. Bradley, Wheeler, Harkness, M. Bradley, Hughes, Jameson, Atiendo, L. Williams, Penny. Subs: Lake, McDermott, Deakin, Leaver, Tilt</p>
  <p>Referee: A. Marriner (Coventry)</p>
  <p>A keenly contested friendly was cut short by five minutes at the end of the first-half when Mick Halsall led his team into the dressing room after a confrontation between Lewis Baker and Leroy Williams in front of the Walsall dug-out.</p>
  <p>Halesowen continued to look lively in their pre-season preparations and in the 12th minute Alex Cowley's corner was flicked on by Asa Charlton for Lewis Baker to head over the bar. Walsall's Leroy Williams beat Dan Jones and cut in from the left in the 19th minute but Mark Sheils saved low down. Cowley then cleverly side-stepped his defender in the 21st minute and beat goalkeeper Dean Coleman but his shot hit the roof of the net from a tight angle. Cowley's 26th minute cross was then met by a firm header from Baker but Coleman made a superb reflex save. A minute late Halesowen goalkeeper Mark Sheils made a fine save from Leroy Williams on a Walsall breakaway.</p>
  <p>Exciting Cowley started and finished Halesowen's 33rd minute goal when he ran at the Walsall defence and put live-wire Jimmy Haarhoff free on the right and he crossed for COWLEY to side-foot home from 10 yards out. The crowd was then left bemused on 40 minutes after a tough tackle by Baker on Leroy Williams led to a minor skirmish and the Walsall players were led back to the dressing room en masse.</p>
  <p>Walsall levelled the scores four minutes into the second half when substitute David McDERMOTT swept home a right-wing cross from close range after Mark Bradley beat Dave Haywood down the right wing.</p>
  <p>Cowley hit wide from the edge of the area on 50 minutes and the alert Haarhoff won the first of two 57th minute corners when he beat the Walsall defence to the ball. Substitute Nicky Preston then turned in the area in the 72nd minute and hit just wide from 8 yards from Haywood's right-wing free-kick. On 78 minutes Richard Burgess set up Jason Moore to hit at the goalkeeper and three minutes later Moore set up Stuart Skidmore to drive wide of the mark.</p>

  <p>Well we finally scored some goals - three in fact - and once again things look reasonably promising for the new seaosn ahead.

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Skidmore, Haywood, Preston, Jones, Pope, Cowley, Haarhoff, Burgess, Baker, Steane. Used Subs: J. Moore, Charlton, Forsdick, Colwell, Williams (GK).</p>
  <p>Worcester City: McDonnell; Warner, Davies, Heeley (Parker 71), Woolley, McDonald (Hobbs 78), Colley (J. Skyers 71), Stanley, Webster (Atkinson 58), C. Moore (Owen 49), Khan. Unused Subs: L. Skyers, Reynolds, Smith</p>
  <p>Referee: L. Sinclair (Brierley Hill) Attendance: 213</p>
  <p>The Yeltz notched their first pre-season victory in style with a comfortable win over a full strength Worcester City from the newly formed Conference North.</p>
  <p>In a lively Halesowen opening, Alex Cowley made a trademark weaving run into the Worcester half in the 3rd minute and a minute later Rob Warner headed behind his own goal for a corner.</p>
  <p>Jimmy HAARHOFF put the Yeltz ahead from the penalty spot with Halesowen's first pre-season goal in the 7th minute after the referee spotted a push on Lewis Baker, much to the surprise of the Worcester defence. Slack defending almost gifted Halesowen a second goal in the 14th minute when Richard Burgess was left unmarked but he volleyed over the bar from Ben Steane's corner.</p>
  <p>Steve Pope made a saving tackle on Shabir Khan in the 20th minute before Adam Webster set up Jai STANLEY to level the scores on 27 minutes by driving past goalkeeper Mark Sheils from the edge of the area. Barry Woolley then headed a Webster cross just wide three minutes before the interval.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz killed the game as a meaningful contest with two goals early in the second half. Steve Pope headed against the underside of the crossbar in the 53rd minute and Danny McDonnell scrambled away the rebound but POPE poked home the ball at the third attempt from close range. Hard-working Jimmy Haarhoff then hit over the bar in the 55th minute from Jason Moore's lay-off.</p>
  <p>Jason MOORE added a third goal in the 61st minute by calmly chipping over McDonnell from 20 yards after latching onto a long ball out of defence and shrugging off a challenge from Carl Heeley. Worcester made little impression on the lead and it was home striker Burgess who blasted against the side-netting with nine minutes remaining.</p>

  <p>The home side then settled into some neat play with Philip Midworth turning away Jason Moore's cross on 8 minutes. Ben Steane's 18th minute corner was cleared off Nicky Preston's head and Alex Cowley's shot forced the second of three consecutive corner kicks. Goalkeeper Matthew Jones then grabbed a deep Dave Haywood free-kick in the 23rd minute. Clever footwork out of defence by home man-of-the-match Cowley inspired a lightning 26th minute break with Moore's cross inches from conversion by Richard Burgess.</p>
  <p>Late in the first half Mark Sheils touched a 20-yard Hughes drive over the crossbar and then made a superb point-blank save from Stuart Nicholson's header after a Hughes cross.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's best chance of the game fell three minutes into the second half with Simon Forsdick heading against the underside off the Baggies' crossbar from Haywood's right-wing free-kick. Tom Barnett then headed over his own goal under pressure from Moore as the Yeltz forced two 62nd minute corners against a totally changed second half line-up from the visitors. The hosts employed rolling substitutions and Burgess hit wide in the 68th minute from a Moore break.</p>
  <p>With 9 minutes remaining Brain Smikle headed inches wide of substitute goalkeeper Richard Williams but SMIKLE wrapped up the game in the final minute by chipping over the goalkeeper from the edge of the area.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2004/07/05/IT'S%20STARTING%20AGAIN.html">IT'S STARTING AGAIN</a></h2>
    <h3></h3>

    <p>
  <p>After a few weeks off watching the usual disappointing England display, thoughts come around once again to the new season. It's just a couple of weeks until the friendlies start - fixtures now added - and then the excitement of a few new places to visit following the pyramid reorganisation and our entry into the revamped Premier Division. More details when the fixture list comes out.</p>
  <p>It's been reasonably quiet so far on the transfer front, with the most notable signing that of Richard Burgess, a striker from Redditch. Again, all will become a bit clearer after the usual round of triallists playing in the pre-season games.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Team Bath 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We've finally reached the end of a pretty uneventful season (on the pitch at least!) by achieving the minimum necessary - finishing in the top seven to get into the Southern Premier next season. It was looking a bit dicey at one stage, so well done to Paul Holleran and the players for turning things around, and we go into what should be a very interesting season with some hope that we can challenge for promotion.</p>
  <p>We clinched fourth place with another victory over Team Bath, this time 1-0 through a first-half Forsdick goal. Elsewhere, Redditch clinched the title with a 3-0 victory at Cirencester, and go on to play King's Lynn and then possibly Merthyr in the playoffs.</p>
  <p>The actual makeup of whatever league we'll end up in should be sorted out by next Sunday (May 9th). I'll post here as soon as I know anything, but I can also recommend  <a href="http://www.tonykempster.co.uk">Tony Kempster's excellent site</a>  for in-depth coverage of the whole subject.</p>
  <p>Asa Charlton has won both the official and the website player of the season, so congratulations to him on both accounts!</p>
  <p>I'd just like to wish everyone an excellent summer, and let's hope next season we can recapture some of that old spirit of Halesowen that has been a little lacking at times recently.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Grocutt, Haywood, Strachan, Jones, Skidmore, Steane (Hollis 72), Moore (Haarhoff 78), Lamey (Carter 89), Baker, Forsdick. Unused Sub: Colwell</p>
  <p>Team Bath: Hines (Chitty 72); Otto (Smith 71), Watson, Nichols, Ball, Tisdale, Saunders, Lock, Stocco, Lewis, Dembicki (Keen HT). Unused Subs: Tilson, Parkin</p>
  <p>Referee: M. J. Gooding (Bristol) Attendance: 401 Booked: Nichols (80), Grocutt (80). Sponsors' Man of the Match: Simon Forsdick</p>
  <p>Halesowen secured fourth spot in the league table as they continued their run of form with a narrow win over sixth placed Team Bath.</p>
  <p>Head Coach Paul Tisdale took charge of Team Bath and they opened brightly with skipper Kevin Watson firing over the bar in the 3rd minute and Watson's free-kick was grabbed by home goalkeeper Mark Sheils five minutes later. Neil Saunders then fed Chris Lewis in the 12th minute but defender Dave Haywood made a timely challenge to intercept.</p>
  <p>Halesowen gradually settled and started to dominate with Nathan Lamey breaking free down the left in the 16th minute to strike the side-netting. Haywood hit a hopeful 35-yard drive in the 19th minute and a minute later goalkeeper Ali Hines raced out of his goal to head clear. Lewis Baker's 22nd minute header from a Haywood corner was hooked clear and on 27 minutes a slip from Peter Tisdale let in Lamey but Hines clawed away his chip and Alex Ball cleared off the line as Jason Moore followed up from the rebound. Hines then raced off his line again on the half-hour to beat Moore to the ball.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz hit the decisive winning goal in the 31st minute when the ball fell kindly from a midfield challenge on Lamey for man-of-the-match Simon FORSDICK to calmly take on the ball from 30 yards out and finish well from 15 yards with a side-foot past Hines.</p>
  <p>A long effort from Forsdick almost caught out Hines after he slipped at the start of an evenly matched second half but then a dreadful error from home goalkeeper Sheils presented substitute Doug Keen with a golden 49th minute chance but he tamely shot at Sheils when clear on goal. Tisdale cleared off the Team Bath line in the 49th minute from Lamey's cross with Moore racing in and at the other end Sheils raced off his line on 54 minutes to deny Tom Stocco after his clever flick.</p>
  <p>With Team Bath searching for an equaliser Lewis just failed to connect with Keen's cross along the face of goal in the 62nd minute and two minutes later Sheils acrobatically clutched another 10-yard Keen effort.</p>
  <p>Moore almost connected with a 69th minute chip from Ben Steane at the far post and in the 74th minute Stuart Skidmore put Moore clear but substitute goalkeeper Darren Chitty was quickly off his line to save. A minute later Dan Jones sliced a cross from substitute Dean Smith for a corner but then cleared Watson's cross.</p>
  <p>Although the game petered out there was still a hint of the intense rivalry from the FA Trophy clashes between the two sides earlier in the season as Jon Nichols and Darren Grocutt received yellow cards for clashing and squaring up to each other with 10 minutes remaining.</p>
  <p>In the dying moments of a successful but quickly forgettable promotion season Baker headed Strachan's 83rd minute corner high over the bar and a long ball from Jimmy Haarhoff found fellow substitute Simon Hollis but he stumbled in front of goal.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2004/04/24/ALMOST%20OVER.html">ALMOST OVER</a></h2>
    <h3>Taunton 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>In what's been a pretty uneventful season, the mighty Yeltz gained an unimportant point in the last away game of the season down in Taunton.</p>
  <p>It was a beautifully sunny day, and a decent  sized band of away supporters took full advantage! We probably had the better of the game, scored a decent goal through Jason, but then they equalised near the end, and probably deserved it. Full match details in Dave's report.</p>
  <p>Next week we finish the season with a home game against Team Bath. Neither team really have anything to play for, with us both having clinched a top seven finish, although if we win we'll finish in fourth place, if not we may finish lower. At the top Gloucester beat Redditch to take the title race to the last weekend, but Redditch only need a point (but have to go to Cirencester so it's not going to be easy).</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Taunton Town: Edwards; Raybould, Dicks, Russell (Aguido 84), Watson, Harris, Fisher, Callinan (Allen 75), Foster, Douglas, Lynch. Unused Subs: Peckham, Musker, Mogg</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Grocutt, Forsdick (Gallieri 87), Haywood, Jones, Skidmore, Steane (Colwell 77), Moore, Lamey (Carter 84), Baker, Strachan. Unused Sub: Haarhoff</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Spence (Newquay) Attendance: 384 Booked: Lamey (58), Callinan (60), Watson (75)</p>
  <p>Halesowen seemed on course for victory but had to settle for a draw after conceding a late goal in their final away game of the campaign. The travelling away fans brought the highest attendance of the season to Wordsworth Road in a game where the visitors gave a run-out to a number of their fringe players.</p>
  <p>Darren Grocutt headed behind his own goal in the 5th minute and Danny Harris back-headed Martin Douglas's resulting corner at the near post but Dave Haywood cleared off the line. A 9th minute cross from Grantley Dicks then just evaded Tommy Callinan at the back post.</p>
  <p>Halesowen eased into their stride and their first corner on 12 minutes saw Ben Steane fire into a crowd of players. Two minutes later Simon Forsdick broke down the left from a long Mark Sheils clearance but Nathan Lamey blasted the ball over the bar. Craig Strachan clipped a ball into Lamey's path on 27 minutes but his effort was cleared after beating goalkeeper Paul Edwards. Edwards then collected a 25-yard free-kick from Haywood on the half-hour.</p>
  <p>At the other end Antony Lynch scuffed his shot from a Dicks cross on 33 minutes and a minute later Taunton were unfortunate to see a 22-yard shot from Callinan beat Sheils but the ball rebounded off the inside of the post in the best chance of the half. Taunton won three corners in the final minutes of the first-half and a Jason Moore flick gave the Yeltz a 38th minute corner.</p>
  <p>Gary Fisher hit a loose ball over the bar from 12-yards for the hosts playing up the slope in the 4th minute of the second period. Halesowen then grabbed the lead in the 53rd minute when Steane skipped past two defenders into the area and squared the ball for MOORE to hit the roof of the net from 15 yards to record his first league goal since January</p>
  <p>Taunton attempted to reply when Lynch latched onto a pass from Andy Raybould in the 57th minute but could only hit the side-netting from 10-yards under challenge from the hard-working Stuart Skidmore. Lynch then hit a 22-yard free-kick inches over the bar but Halesowen continued to control play with their neat passing approach.</p>
  <p>Taunton captain Alex Watson received a yellow-card in the 75th minute for spectacularly up-ending Skidmore although play had already been stopped for an earlier infringement. Halesowen substitute Alfie Carter then raced down the left wing in the 86th minute but his cross was cleared.</p>
  <p>The Peacocks snatched their 89th minute equaliser when a corner from substitute Danny Allen bounced awkwardly and left unmarked Adrian FOSTER with the simple task of nodding home from close range.</p>
  <p>In six minutes of added time Strachan hit over the Taunton bar from substitute Antonio Gallieri's free-kick and Sheils collected a shot from Harris in the Halesowen goal.</p>
