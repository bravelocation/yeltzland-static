    <h3>Yeltz 1 Rugby 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz made sure of an all-important top seven finish with a hard-fought victory over Rugby. A first half penalty from Asa Charlton made all the difference, and with Sutton losing we're now guaranteed to finish in the "promotion" positions.</p>
  <p>Just as importantly, we can now party at Taunton next week without worrying about the result. I'm not sure if there are any plans as yet for the traditional last away game of the season fancy dress, but what ever happens I'm sure there'll be a big turnout - see you all there.</p>
  <p>There's a new vote on the site - an unofficial player of the season - if you're interested! (it's working now - apologies for the poor performance by the hosting company again)</p>
  <p>In Fantasy Island, it looks like Kev Crook has amazingly won again being 18 points clear with only two games left. Still no idea how he does it :-)</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Grocutt, Haywood, Charlton, Jones, Skidmore, Steane (Colwell 88), Forsdick, Haarhoff (Carter 85), Baker, Foy (Strachan 65). Unused Subs: Gallieri, Hollis</p>
  <p>Rugby United: Pearcey; Moran (Charley 90), Williams, Hart, Commander, Rutherford, Squire, Dutton, Beard, Marsden, Hegarty (Pearson 76). Unused Subs: Redgate, Herbert, Thomas</p>
  <p>Referee: W. Ramsay (Coventry) Attendance: 456 Booked: Dutton (41), Charlton (80) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Dave Haywood</p>
  <p>Halesowen clinched a top-seven promotion spot with Asa Charlton's first-half penalty separating the two sides.</p>
  <p>Although looking lightweight up front Halesowen started brightly and Dave Haywood almost beat Rugby goalkeeper Jason Pearcey to the ball in the 7th minute. Two minutes later Stuart Skidmore controlled the ball and fired over the bar from the edge of the area and Pearcey raced off his line in the 22nd minute to claim the ball when David Foy burst forward from midfield.</p>
  <p>Rugby appeared content to try to claim a point to help guarantee their own promotion cause but as they settled home goalkeeper Mark Sheils grabbed a 29th minute cross from Justin Marsden and Robbie Beard hit over the bar with a 30th minute free-kick. Simon Forsdick's pass to Charlton fell short and let in Marsden in the 31st minute but he flashed the ball wide after running through from midfield.</p>
  <p>CHARLTON slammed home the winning goal for the Yeltz in the 37th minute from the penalty spot after Jimmy Haarhoff was brought down despite the protestations of Michael Hegarty and Craig Dutton.</p>
  <p>Rugby poured forward in the second half and Andy Commander nodded a Hegarty free-kick wide of goal in the 55th minute. Sheils then tipped away a fine 25-yard effort from Gary Moran before saving a 25-yard free-kick from Jamie Williams.</p>
  <p>Ben Steane missed a good opportunity to increase Halesowen's lead in the 65th minute when he hit Forsdick's cross wide from 10 yards. Sheils collected a 20-yard free-kick from Beard at the second attempt in the 66th minute but Rugby wasted a number of free-kicks conceded by Halesowen on the edge of their own area. Charlton then cleared off his own line after Sheils fumbled a 70th minute corner but Sheils recovered to block a 71st minute Beard shot with Halesowen pegged back.</p>
  <p>Skidmore almost weaved his way through the Rugby defence on 73 minutes and two minutes later Pearcey saved with his legs from Haarhoff who was put through by substitute Craig Strachan. In injury time substitute Alfie Carter hit the side netting from fellow substitute Richard Colwell's through ball.</p>

    <h3>Sutton Coldfield 3 Yeltz 1 and Yeltz 0 Bromsgrove 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz's fine run of form came to an abrupt end over the Bank Holiday weekend with two disappointing performances and results against fellow promotion chasing Sutton and Bromsgrove. However we've now guaranteed a top eight finish, and need only four points at most to avoid the play-off spot and ensure we get promotion.</p>
  <p>Saturday's game at Sutton was particularly disappointing, but they played much better than us and fully deserved their victory. By all accounts we were a bit better at home on Monday, but Bromsgrove probably had the better chances.</p>
  <p>At the top of the league Redditch are faltering badly and can now be caught by Gloucester (as they still have to play them). We've got just three games left now, starting with Rugby at The Grove on Saturday.</p>

    <h3>Evesham 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>An excellent away win by the mighty Yeltz at Evesham means that we're in sight of clinching that all-important top seven spot for promotion into the Premier Division next season. Despite going behind once again, we came back through goals from Jimmy Haarhoff and Nathan Lamey to win 2-1.</p>
  <p>
    We're back up to  although both Gloucester and Cirencester have games in hand. It's complicated because several of the top 9 still have to play each other, but I'm pretty confident in saying if we win our two games over the holiday weekend we're definitely up.
    
  </p>
  <p>Those two games are against Sutton Coldfield (away on Saturday) and then Bromsgrove (at The Grove on Monday). It's not going to be easy, but we are on an excellent run of form under the new management regime, so let's hope we can continue this for a little longer and ensure our promotion as soon as we can.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Evesham United: Clarke; Smith, Pinkney, Marsh (Nicholls 66), Bailey, Parker, Burrow, Thomas, Clark (Hawley 88), Pountney (Canning 66), Williams. Unused Subs: West, Guest</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Haywood, Charlton, Jones, Skidmore, Hollis, Haarhoff (Carter 90), Lamey (Moore 71), Baker (Steane 75), Foy. Unused Subs: Forsdick, Strachan</p>
  <p>Referee: H. Singh (West Bromwich) Attendance: 250</p>
  <p>Halesowen climbed to second place in the table after recovering from a goal down in a poor start to end up worthy winners. The meeting brought together the two previous Solihull managers in opposite dug-outs and ended with Paul Holleran maintaining his unbeaten managerial record at the Halesowen helm.</p>
  <p>The Robins started brightly and Halesowen had a let-off after just 40 seconds when Danny Williams latched onto a bad back-pass but full-back Richard Colwell cleared off the line. Jermaine Clark's 6th minute shot was then parried away by goalkeeper Mark Sheils with the loose ball rolling agonisingly wide. David Foy headed a 7th minute Dave Haywood corner inches wide for Halesowen but Evesham deservedly took the lead in the 9th minute when centre-half Dan Jones ducked out of a header in his own penalty area allowing WILLIAMS to fire home from 12 yards. Sheils then raced out of his area in the 13th minute to deny Williams before Halesowen finally stepped up a gear.</p>
  <p>Former Halesowen goalkeeper Tim Clarke denied Nathan Lamey in the 17th minute when free on goal with Simon Hollis then heading Lamey's cross tamely at Clarke. Haywood's corner curled just wide of Clarke's post on 23 minutes and on the half-hour Lewis Baker's acrobatic volley from 6 yards fell just wide.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's pressure finally paid off with a 35th minute equaliser when the Evesham defence allowed Jimmy HAARHOFF to advance on goal and roll a 20-yard shot into the corner of the net. Lamey then twice hit wide from 25 yards after 37 and 38 minutes and with Halesowen finishing the half strongly Haarhoff fed Lamey from a Hollis break but the striker put the ball wide from 12 yards after side-stepping his defender.</p>
  <p>LAMEY made amends by notching Halesowen's winning goal in the 55th minute by taking down the ball and striking a positive shot from the edge of the area with Clarke only able to reach the ball with his fingertips. Baker then just failed to connect with a dangerous ball across goal from Lamey on the hour. With the visitors finishing in control of the game a 25-yard volley from Haywood was turned away for a corner by Clarke in the 74th minute and Haarhoff then put substitute Jason Moore clear on 79 minutes but Clarke made another fine save.</p>

    <h3>Yate 1 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    Every point counts at the moment, so it was vital that the mighty Yeltz fought back from behind against Yate to keep our unbeaten run going. A late penalty equaliser from Nathan Lamey gained us a point that keeps us in  with just six games left. Full details in Dave's match report.
    
  </p>
  <p>On Saturday we travel again, this time to another lower-placed club in Evesham. We lost to them in the league earlier in the season, but since then they've lost Sean Flynn and are struggling at present, so let's hope for three points to edge closer to that top-seven finish.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Yate Town: Court; Smith, Powell, Ward, Brooks (Metheringham 13), Wood (Hughes 66), Wyatt, Campbell, Bennett, Rawlins, Neal. Unused Subs: Pritchard, White, Barlass</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell (Moore 70), Haywood, Charlton, Jones, Skidmore, Hollis, Haarhoff (Grocutt 87), Lamey, Foy, Forsdick (Strachan 70). Unused Subs: Steane, Carter</p>
  <p>Referee: P. Brown (Taunton) Attendance: 169 Booked: None</p>
  <p>Halesowen recovered from a disappointing start to claim a draw and inch ever closer towards a guaranteed top-seven placing required to move up the non-league ladder.</p>
  <p>Jason Moore and Ben Steane were delayed by congestion on the M40 so Jimmy Haarhoff made his full debut and struck wide from a David Foy free-kick in the 3rd minute. Jason Wood then flashed well wide for Yate in the 6th minute before the Yeltz won their first corner of the evening on 17 minutes but Simon Hollis put his cross wide.</p>
  <p>The hosts were already without central defender David Elsey and defender Nick Brooks then limped off in the 13th minute but Halesowen failed to exploit the weakness at the heart of the Yate defence. The home side went ahead in the 19th minute when a back header from Matt RAWLINS looped over goalkeeper Mark Sheils from Gary Powell's 30-yard free-kick in a disappointing goal from a defensive point-of-view. Sheils then collected a 27th minute curling cross from Wood and substitute Paul Metheringham hit wide from 20 yards.</p>
  <p>Haarhoff weaved through the Yate rearguard on the half-hour but goalkeeper Tony Court kept out Nathan Lamey's shot. Simon Forsdick then headed a 33rd minute free-kick just wide and two minutes before the interval Court collected a low Haarhoff shot from the edge of the area.</p>
  <p>A minute into the second half Hollis hit a right-wing cross just inches too high for Lamey from a good position and two minutes later Hollis hit a loose ball over the bar from 20-yards in a spell of pressure. However, Stuart Skidmore's slip let in Rawlins on 51 minutes but he hit his cross over the bar and three minutes later Mike Wyatt headed a Powell corner wide.</p>
  <p>Court punched clear Dave Haywood's free-kick under pressure on 64 minutes and with 20 minutes remaining on the clock manager Paul Holleran introduced Moore in a tactical switch to play three up front in an attempt to retrieve the game. Foy's shot was deflected for a 74th minute corner but a minute later Sheils turned a curling 25-yard free-kick from Steve Campbell over the bar on a Yate break.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz finally equalised in the 80th minute when Metheringham clipped Haarhoof's legs on the turn in the penalty area and LAMEY slammed home the resulting penalty to register his first goal for the club.</p>
  <p>Wyatt headed a corner at Sheils on 81 minutes and two minutes later Sheils made a fine save low down from Campbell. The final few minutes were played out in the Yate half and in the last minute Asa Charlton hit over the bar after a corner was scrambled clear.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Redditch 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Our last chance of possibly catching Redditch and earning the Conference playoff spot appears to have gone when we drew 0-0 with the league leaders at The Grove. In an incident-filled match, both teams ended up with 10 players and we missed a penalty, but with us still 13 points behind them with one game in hand (and only seven games left), they are looking set for a well-deserved title. Full details in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>That game in hand is played on Tuesday when we travel to Bristol to play Yate Town. We beat them in a hard-fought game at The Grove a few weeks ago, but lets hope we can get a similar result this time.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Haywood, Charlton, Jones, Skidmore, Hollis, Moore (Haarhoff 82), Lamey, Baker, Forsdick (Foy HT). Unused Subs: Grocutt, Steane, Carter</p>
  <p>Redditch United: Anstiss; Manton, Gardiner, Taylor, Knight, Softley (Woodley 61), Hall (Quiggin 77), Flynn, Leadbeater (Burgess 77), Shepherd, Cowley. Unused Subs: Scheppel, Voice</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Weaver (Bearwood) Attendance: 636 Booked: Charlton (17), Taylor (30), Haywood (44), Cowley (57) Sent Off: Lamey (66), Woodley (85). Sponsors' Man of the Match: Lewis Baker</p>
  <p>Goalkeeper Richard Anstiss saved a late Halesowen penalty to keep Redditch racing relentlessly towards the title in a compelling game that saw both sides reduced to ten men.</p>
  <p>Halesowen weathered a torrid opening spell as the title-chasing Reds who named seven former Yeltz players in their line-up tore into action. Richard Leadbeater crashed a header against the crossbar from Matty Hall's corner after just 40 seconds and Hall whipped over another dangerous cross which just evaded Leadbeater a minute later. Alex Cowley then drove over the bar from 20-yards in the 7th minute.</p>
  <p>Halesowen gradually settled and an 8th minute Nathan Lamey cross was just too high for Jason Moore and Simon Hollis whipped over a 25-yard free-kick five minutes later.</p>
  <p>Mark Sheils rescued the Yeltz in the 19th minute with a flying reflex save after Hall squared a free-kick from the edge of the area for Cowley to hit a goal-bound 20-yard drive. Opposite goalkeeper Richard Anstiss then saved a Lewis Baker shot in the 18th minute and saved a Baker header on the half-hour from Stuart Skidmore's cross. The Reds finished the first-half strongly with a 39th minute Sean Flynn volley turned away for a corner before Matt Gardiner flicked a 42nd minute header against the crossbar from a Flynn corner.</p>
  <p>Although the first half belonged to the Reds the Yeltz were in the driving seat for the second half. The hosts won two early corners but then had full-back Richard Colwell to thank for heading Leadbeater's effort off his own goal-line after Sheils failed to claim a deep 54th minute cross. With the game played at an increasingly furious pace Anstiss punched away a 58th minute cross from substitute David Foy and Gardiner headed clear a 62nd minute corner from Dave Haywood.</p>
  <p>The game erupted in the 66th minute when Lamey was shown a red-card for elbowing despite Lewis Baker appealing for a home penalty. Ten-man Halesowen continued to dominate with Foy's 69th minute corner scrambled away by the Redditch defence before Foy headed yet another Haywood corner wide a minute later. At the other end Gardiner headed a Hall free-kick just over the bar on the counter-attack on 73 minutes.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were rewarded for their hard-work in the 78th minute when a Simon Hollis shot struck Neil Manton's arm and the referee awarded a penalty but Anstiss made a splendid diving save to his left to keep out Foy's well struck spot-kick. Anstiss then went on to keep out a Baker header on 80 minutes but Sheils then saved Halesowen by racing off his line to save from Cowley in the clear on the break for Redditch in the 84th minute.</p>
  <p>With five minutes remaining Redditch were reduced to ten men when substitute Craig Woodley was also shown a straight red-card for violent conduct.</p>

    <h3>Cirencester 0 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    Paul Holleran's excellent start as new Yeltz manager continued when we completed the double over title-chasing Cirencester on Saturday. An early goal from an in-form Simon Hollis clinched an important 1-0 victory, and took us back up to .
    
  </p>
  <p>We're probably out of the running for the title but if we are going to win this division we must beat leaders Redditch on Saturday. We've already beaten them once - and have generally done very well against the top teams this season - so let's hope our good form continues for the next few weeks.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Cirencester Town: Thompson; Davis, McEntegart, Richards, Mayo (Bevan 67), Wotton, Robison, Wimble, Hopkins, Griffin, Jackson. Unused Subs: Bird, McCabe, Fraser, Fitch</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Haywood (Grocutt 71), Charlton, Jones, Skidmore, Hollis, Moore (Haarhoff 83), Lamey, Baker, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Steane, Strachan</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Williams (Hereford) Attendance: 220 Booked: Skidmore (66)</p>
  <p>Halesowen proved that a week is a long time in football by picking up their third successive win to complete the double over title-chasing Cirencester and maintain new manager Paul Holleran's perfect start.</p>
  <p>The visitors quickly mastered the gale-force winds and created a great 3rd minute chance when Stuart Skidmore won the ball in midfield allowing the inspired Simon Hollis to play a defence-splitting ball into the area but Simon Forsdick hit wide from 12 yards. Four minutes later Forsdick took the ball around Paul Thompson but the home goalkeeper recovered to concede a corner.</p>
  <p>Hard-working Halesowen hit the solitary winning goal in the 10th minute when new signing Dave Haywood played a short corner back to HOLLIS and his cross-shot sailed into the far corner of the net.</p>
  <p>Hollis continued to cause danger as an outlet on the right and with the hosts blown off course by the conditions Gareth Hopkins sliced wide on 15 minutes. Jason Moore chased a long ball in the 19th minute to set up Nathan Lamey but Thompson saved with his legs and Haywood's resulting corner was cleared off the Cirencester line as the visitors created the cleaner chances.</p>
  <p>The Centurians won their first corner in the 36th minute but the Yeltz finished the first-half strongly with Garry Wotton heading away another Hollis cross for a corner and Lamey cutting in from the right to test Thompson with a 20-yard drive three minutes before the interval.</p>
  <p>Below-par Cirencester failed to capitalise down the slope at the start of the second period and it was Halesowen's Lewis Baker who headed a Stuart Skidmore cross over the bar three minutes after the break. The visitors then weathered a storm with Cirencester winning three corners in quick succession but improving goalkeeper Mark Sheils tipped away a 52nd minute Scott Griffin shot and pushed away a Gareth Hopkins shot on 56 minutes. Wotton then headed over the bar and home full-back Michael Davis hit high from 25-yards in the 73rd minute.</p>
  <p>With the howling wind finally abating, the Yeltz almost increased their lead on the break with two minutes remaining when Thompson's clearance was charged down putting substitute Jimmy Haarhoff in the clear but the assistant referee flagged for offside.</p>

    <h3>Cinderford 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    An eventful day. After the surprise appointment of Paul Holleran as new Yeltz manager, we won 2-1 at Cinderford to make an excellent start under the new regime. We led 2-0 at half-time through Forsdick and Hollis, before struggling in the second-half and conceding a late goal. Full details in .
    
  </p>
  <p>Mr Holleran was previously manager at Solihull, and wasn't one of the candidates mentioned in most reports. However, he's clearly done very well at Solihull on limited resources, and all of our most successful managers in the past have come from smaller clubs. In any case, I'm sure everyone will join me in welcoming Paul to the club, and wishing him every success in his new position.</p>
  <p>He's not exactly got the easiest of starts, with our next two games against the top two in the division. On Saturday we travel to Cirencester, before hosting leaders Redditch a week later at The Grove. It's not going to be easy, although we have beaten both teams already this season, so we must be hopeful of getting something out of both games.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Cinderford Town: Fisher; Carns, Gioia, Townsend, Steadman, Hammonds, C. Addis, Hook, Joyce, D. Addis, Truman (Belfitt 68). Unused Subs: Foxwell, Ranford, Davies, Clark</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Charlton, Skidmore, Jones, Baker, Hollis, Moore (Hemmings HT), Lamey, Forsdick, Carter. Unused Subs: Strachan, Gallieri, Grocutt, Mason</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Bryant (Bristol) Attendance: 200 Booked: Hammonds (19), Steadman (56), C. Addis (57), Joyce (75), Baker (83), Skidmore (90).</p>
  <p>Paul Holleran celebrated his first game in charge of Halesowen with two first half goals in a minute to set up victory but then had goalkeeper Mark Sheils to thank for surviving a second-half battering from rock-bottom Cinderford.</p>
  <p>Uncompromising Cinderford made the early running in a frantic start and delivered a number of deep crosses in the opening minutes with a Jamie Hammonds free-kick cleared in the 11th minute. Two minutes later a Wesley Joyce free-kick from the edge of the penalty area was turned away at full stretch by Halesowen goalkeeper Sheils. New signing Nathan Lamey headed a Simon Hollis corner wide on 16 minutes but it was Sheils again who rescued the visitors by parrying away a Hammonds drive following a right-wing cross.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz eventually settled and looked lively going forward with Dan Jones rising on 19 minutes to head a Hollis free-kick but the ball rebounded off the inside of the stanchion and the apparent goal was not given. Home goalkeeper Andy Fisher then made a flying save to keep out a Lewis Baker header from another Hollis corner in the 22nd minute.</p>
  <p>Simon FORSDICK gave Halesowen the lead by dispossessing Dave Carns in the 25th minute and produced a tremendous finish to lob Fisher from 16 yards. A minute later HOLLIS picked up the ball in midfield and his shot took a cruel deflection off Antonio Goioa to loop over Fisher for the second goal. Baker's overhead kick in the 32nd minute fell inches wide of the far post and Hollis was denied twice before the interval after being used as a dangerous outlet on the break from the right.</p>
  <p>Hard-working Cinderford belied their lowly position to come out in the second half with all guns blazing and put Halesowen under a barrage of pressure.</p>
  <p>Sheils turned away a Daryl Addis shot on 47 minutes before Forsdick hit a 20-yard drive at Fisher four minutes later at the other end. A Forsdick cross then found Hollis but Cinderford blocked for a corner and Hollis then delayed too long in front of goal on 55 minutes from Baker's pass.</p>
  <p>Cinderford found the net on 63 minutes from a free-kick on the edge of the area but the assistant referee spotted that a hand put the ball in the net rather than a header and the goal was rightly disallowed. Joyce then beat Sheils to the ball but the goalkeeper and his defence recovered to clear in the 65th minute. Joyce then made a crude challenge on Sheils as he raced off his line in the 75th minute and the assistant referee again remained alert to signal the incident to his referee. After receiving treatment, Sheils stood up to make an acrobatic save to deny a Joyce header a minute later and in constant pressure Baker cleared off the line in the 78th minute. Sheils made another flying save from a 25-yard Chris Addis shot in the 79th minute and Joyce struck wide at the far post on 86 minutes from a Daryl Addis cross for the tough home side.</p>
  <p>The home pressure finally paid off in the 87th minute when HAMMONDS drove home a loose ball for a consolation goal from 15 yards but the Yeltz weathered the storm to gain all three points and move back up to fifth position in the league.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Yate 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>With all the difficulties off the field with Brendan leaving, it was important that we turned things around on the pitch, so with a Lewis Baker goal late in the second half, the mighty Yeltz gained an important 1-0 victory over Yate at The Grove. Well done to everyone involved!</p>
  <p>
    With the table starting to sort itself out now, we're back up to , with games in hand over the three teams below us. Six of our last ten games are against other teams in the top nine, so it really is all to play for. However if we can just play to our potential, the crucial top seven place should be easily achievable.
    
  </p>
  <p>No news as yet on the manager front, although there have been several interviews with Brendan saying the reason he left was that some of the board were plotting behind his back to get rid of him.</p>
  <p>Anyway, looking forward we've got two matches this week: we visit bottom-placed Cinderford on Tuesday, before visiting title-chasing Cirencester on Saturday. We must be hoping for three points from the first game, and we did beat Cirencester a few weeks ago so we could well get something out of that game too. Let's hope so.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Charlton, Skidmore, Jones, Baker, Hollis, Moore, Hemmings (Strachan 85), Steane (Forsdick 39), Carter. Unused Subs: Gallieri, Grocutt, Mason</p>
  <p>Yate Town: Court; Smith, Powell, Ward, Elsey, Metheringham, Wyatt, Campbell, Bennett, Rawlins, Hughes (Pritchard 83). Unused Subs: White, Thompson, Barlass</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Williams (Cheltenham) Attendance: 374 Booked: Skidmore (44), Elsey (87), Ward (88) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Simon Forsdick.</p>
  <p>Caretaker Manager Colin Brookes and his senior players guided troubled Halesowen to a narrow victory in a game where the much-needed result counted more than the below-par performance</p>
  <p>A scrappy first half saw Ben Steane test goalkeeper Tony Court with a 20-yard effort in the 2nd minute and Steve Campbell's 19th minute shot then deflected to Mike Wyatt but he hit wide from 12 yards for in-form Yate. On 21 minutes Jason Moore laid the ball off for Simon Hollis on the overlap but he shot just wide and a minute later a long free-kick from Asa Charlton drifted just over the head of Tony Hemmings in a good position with Court collecting the ball.</p>
  <p>Home goalkeeper Mark Sheils then did well to catch a long throw from captain David Elsey in the 26th minute and in the 33rd minute Asa Charlton slipped whilst taking a free-kick and the ball fell for Tony Bennett to speculatively lob just over the bar from 30 yards. Six minutes before half-time Court dived bravely to save at the feet of Hemmings and Halesowen finally won their first corner of the game in the 41st minute. Sheils then caught two long range Yate free-kicks from Campbell and Elsey at the end of a dull first half best summed up by a 45th minute comedy-of-errors when the ball bounced over the head of Dan Jones to set up Matt Rawlins who then hit his shot high over the Shed and out of the ground as he approached goal.</p>
  <p>Entertainment remained scant in the second-half with Yate seemingly happy to look for a draw. However, the visitors almost took a 50th minute lead when a suicidally sloppy back-pass from Alfie Carter let in Rawlins to take the ball around Sheils but full-back Richard Colwell raced back to clear his shot off the line. Simon Forsdick lifted the gloom with a clever 59th minute pass into the box for Hemmings but the striker fired inches over the bar when clear on goal. Sheils then turned away a 63rd minute shot from Campbell at the foot of the post with Rawlins hitting the rebound wide and at the other end Hemmings set up Moore to strike just high three minutes later.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz finally breached the solid Yate defence with an 80th minute winning goal when Lewis BAKER powerfully headed home a deep free-kick from Charlton from close range.</p>
  <p>Halesowen then won two late corners before the final whistle brought relief as the Yeltz finally put their week of difficult news behind them.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2004/03/07/CRISIS.html">CRISIS</a></h2>
    <h3>Gresley 1 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>After a second successive 1-0 league defeat, Brendan Phillips has resigned as Halesowen manager leaving the club in a real state of crisis.</p>
  <p>
    Taking the Gresley game first - it was another disappointing performance and result very similar to the Rugby game. We looked the better team in general, but never really created anywhere near enough changes against a committed set of opponents. They took their chance well, could have scored more and generally deserved to win. We're now down in  and are now worringly close to not making the very important top seven promotion spots.
    
  </p>
  <p>Anyway, any news as soon as I get it - although unfortunately the web site hosting company are being a bit unreliable at the moment, for which I can only apologise.</p>
  <p>On Saturday we host Yate Town at The Grove. They've recovered from a disastrous start to be just below half-way, but let's hope we can turn things around to ensure we can finish off the season in style.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Gresley Rovers: Belford; Everitt, Cheetham, M. Smith, Hood, Slater, Wardle, Doughty (Francis 87), Barrett, Lenagh (Tucker 75), White. Unused Subs: Jackson, Lonergan, Clarke</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell (Strachan 84), Charlton, Grocutt, Jones, Baker, Hollis, Moore, Hemmings (Steane 65), Foy, Carter. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Forsdick, N. Smith</p>
  <p>Referee: R. Merchant (Stone) Attendance: 422 Booked: M. Smith (6), Hood (12), Baker(25), Wardle (44), Jones (45), White (53), Hemmings (58), Charlton (69), Lenagh (71).</p>
  <p>Brendan Phillips resigned as manager of Halesowen Town after three years claiming to have been hounded out and undermined by disgruntled supporters and sources within the club.</p>
  <p>But recent poor form also means that the Yeltz have slipped outside the vital top-seven position needed to ensure their inclusion in the next step of a restructured league and have eleven tough fixtures remaining.</p>
  <p>The game itself produced nine yellow cards and was no classic despite its furious pace but Gresley mastered the basics better and worked their limited resources far harder to take the three points and condemn the Yeltz to a third straight defeat with a solitary first-half goal.</p>
  <p>Jamie Barrett hit over the Yeltz bar in first minute home pressure before Halesowen won their first corner in the third minute. On 6 minutes Tony Hemmings latched onto a long ball from Asa Charlton but was brought down on the edge of the area by Matt Smith with Simon Hollis hitting a rebound wide from David Foy's free-kick.</p>
  <p>Improving goalkeeper Mark Sheils had a fine game in the Halesowen goal against his former club by producing a string of impressive saves and claiming several deep crosses with confidence. Sheils denied Gary White with a 13th minute reflex stop after dithering from defender Dan Jones and three minutes later Leon Doughty volleyed high over the Halesowen bar from Richard Wardle's cross.</p>
  <p>An 18th minute right-wing cross from Hollis was just missed at the far post by Hemmings sliding in at the far post. Alfie Carter then hit wide from 20-yards after 20 minutes and home goalkeeper Dale Belford held onto another 20-yard Carter drive four minutes later.</p>
  <p>Gresley hit the winning goal in the 28th minute when Barrett flicked on a header for Steve LENAGH to make no mistake by crashing past Sheils from 6 yards out. Two minutes later Sheils made a fine save to cling onto a 20-yard effort from White and Sheils then held onto another 20-yard effort from White on 35 minutes. Just before the interval Carter screwed wide in front of the Gresley goal and Andy Cheetham headed a White corner over the Halesowen bar.</p>
  <p>After the break home goalkeeper Dale Belford superbly palmed away a Simon Hollis header from Foy's free-kick on 57 minutes with Halesowen playing down the slope. Lewis Baker then headed a right-wing cross from Hollis wide on 63 minutes before another Hollis cross was turned just past his own post by Leigh Everitt three minutes later. Baker volleyed over the bar on 67 minutes for Halesowen but it was another Jones mistake that let in Lenagh to strike the far post on 74 minutes for the Moatmen</p>
  <p>Belford saved low down to deny a 79th minute header from Charlton following Foy's cross and on 85 minutes Baker turned to shoot in the box but his effort was blocked before Belford then grabbed a freekick from Foy under his own crossbar.</p>
  <p>Craig Strachan was introduced with only six minutes remaining but had no time to make any impression. In the dying seconds Gresley almost claimed a second goal on the break when Carl Francis put fellow substitute Simon Tucker free on goal but Sheils came to the rescue by diving bravely to take the ball from Tucker's feet.</p>

    <h3>WSC  Worcester 3 Yeltz 2 (AET)</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We can fully concentrate on the league now, as The Yeltz were knocked out of their last cup competition last night. Despite coming back from two down with goals from Craig Strachan and Jason Moore (as he's known now), we lost 3-2 in extra time at Worcester in the WSC.</p>
  <p>
    It's very good that Jason got back on the scoresheet again, and let's hope he can score again at  on Saturday. We really have got all to play for still, but we can't afford any more slip-ups now. There are 12 games to go, and winning all of them would take us 87 points (which would have gained !). It's a tall order but we can do it, so come on!

    <h3>Rugby 1 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz are looking a lot less likely to challenge for the league title after losing 1-0 to second-placed Rugby. It was a pretty disappointing display, even though we probably had the better of a poor game without really threatening until the last few minutes. With Redditch winning again we're a long way behind now even if we do win our games in hand.</p>
  <p>Not being a regular at the games it's often difficult for me to comment, but watching yesterday was very frustrating. We don't have a settled nucleus of a team, and this is bound to show when we need to pull together in situations like yesterday. However good some of these temporary signings are, they're not really going to give absolutely everything if they're just playing to get fit or waiting for something better to turn up. Obviously just one not very informed person's opinion though.</p>
  <p>Anyway we've got the irrelevant Worcester Senior Cup on Monday, before visiting Gresley next week in the league. With the FA now ratifying the Conference Division One for next season, we need to continue our steady run of form to ensure we finish in the top seven to get into one of the leagues below the new divisions.</p>

  <p>The mighty Yeltz again failed to beat struggling Shepshed, and missed out on a chance to significantly close the &#xD;

gap on leaders Redditch.</p>
  <p>
    We took the lead in the first half through Forsdick, but they soon equalised and then took the lead halfway &#xD;

the top of the league. Redditch won here last week, so I suspect if we're going to catch them we're going to have to do the &#xD;

    <h3>Bedworth 0 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz kept themselves in the title race on Saturday with a crucial 1-0 victory away to struggling Bedworth. A second-half goal from Simon Hollis kept us in touch with leaders Redditch, who came back from two down to beat second placed Rugby 3-2.</p>
  <p>This week brings another set of away games - on Tuesday we travel to Shepshed, and then on Saturday we visit old rivals Rugby. Both games are very important, and if we can gain six points then I think we've really got a chance of challenging at the top. Come on!</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bedworth Utd: Hateley; Blair (Scott 80), O'Sullivan, Stevenson, Richardson, K. Smith (Goodman 72), Massingham, S. Hadland, Wood, G. Hadland (Rhodes 54), Blake. Unused Subs: Olanipekun, Dodd</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Hollis, Carter, Grocutt (Forsdick HT), Jones, Hoyle, Spencer (Skidmore 12), Ashby, Ball, Steane, Baker. Unused Subs: N. Smith, Strachan</p>
  <p>Referee: J. Hubbard (Leicester) Attendance: 241</p>
  <p>Halesowen did just enough to pick up three important three points in a physical game of few chances. The game had extra spice with former Halesowen centre forward Mark Hallam now managing the Greenbacks and on a tricky playing surface the game turned into a midfield battle.</p>
  <p>The visitors suffered a 9th minute blow when in-form Andy Spencer was stretchered off with a leg injury. Two minutes later a through ball from Jason Ashby - now to be known as Jason Moore following a name change by deed-poll - almost found Simon Hollis but Gary Hateley raced off his line to save.</p>
  <p>Hollis then hit a 25-yard free-kick wide on 19 minutes and at the other end opposite goalkeeper Mark Sheils easily collected Guy Hadland's free-kick a minute later.</p>
  <p>Referee Hubbard caused controversy on 22 minutes in charge of his last ever Southern League game when he stopped play for a minor midfield injury. In the meantime, Richard Ball had broken free from midfield to be clear on goal and was about to hit the target when the whistle blew. Play then resumed with a drop-kick from goalkeeper Hateley half-way inside his own half.</p>
  <p>Bedworth's best chance fell in the 35th minute when James Wood latched onto a loose ball but Sheils produced a reflex save to turn the ball over the bar for a corner. Ashby then broke clear for the Yeltz on 43 minutes but ballooned the ball over the bar from 8 yards out. Seconds before the interval Bedworth's Marvin Blake blasted high as the hosts won two corners.</p>
  <p>The second half continued to be a dour struggle although Ben Steane made a fine run from midfield in the 49th minute before being beaten by a combination of the pitch and a packed defence. Ashby curled wide on 56 minutes and on the hour Hateley saved at the feet of Hollis from Richard Ball's pass.</p>
  <p>Halesowen finally broke the deadlock in the 74th minute when HOLLIS was first to the ball in the Bedworth area and rolled the ball past Hateley from close range to notch the winning goal. With six minutes remaining Sheils grabbed a deep free-kick from Darren Massingham at the second attempt and in the final minute Steane was brought down on the edge of the Bedworth penalty area but Alfie Carter struck the free-kick straight at Hateley.</p>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz shared the points with promotion rivals Gloucester after a 0-0 draw at The Grove. Despite a much better performance than the midweek blip, we couldn't breach the Gloucester defence but both teams will be reasonably happy with the result.</p>
  <p>
    We're back down to , but it was a pretty good day elsewhere with Redditch losing to Sutton Coldfield and Rugby losing to Stourport.
    
  </p>
  <p>We start our epic run of away games next Saturday with a trip to Bedworth, where I think we must pick up all three points to keep in the hunt for the top spot.</p>

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Charlton, Hoyle, Jones, Spencer, Foy, Ashby, Ball, Steane (Forsdick 78), Hollis. Unused Subs: Baker, Skidmore, Grocutt, N. Smith</p>
  <p>Gloucester City: Bath; Webb, Harris (Thompson 61), Howarth, Jefferies, Burns, Mustoe, Cox (Hemming 87), Mings (L. Smith 54), Hoskins, Wilkinson. Unused Sub: Bayliss</p>
  <p>Referee: G. Scott (Abingdon) Attendance: 431 Sponsors' Man of the Match: Andy Spencer. Booked: Hoskins (63), Charlton (85), L.Smith (83)</p>
  <p>Gloucester goalkeeper Matt Bath denied Halesowen with a string of fine saves and crowned his impressive display by saving Jason Ashby's penalty in first-half injury time.</p>
  <p>Despite the blank score-line the teams produced a game of high tempo and quality football with plenty of goal-mouth action. In a bright start from the Yeltz Simon Hollis fed Ashby but his 3rd minute effort was cleared off the goal-line by Dave Wilkinson and Hollis then hit an 11th minute overhead kick at Bath.</p>
  <p>Tigers veteran Adie Harris delivered the first of three dangerous first-half in-swinging corners in the 9th minute but goalkeeper Mark Sheils did well to punch clear. Halesowen's first corner by David Foy in the 16th minute was volleyed into the area by Hollis but Dan Jones hit over the bar from close range. Richard Ball then headed a good Hollis cross wide in a flowing 19th minute move before Foy cracked a 25-yard free-kick against the left-hand Gloucester post.</p>
  <p>Man-of-the-match Andy Spencer made a series of surging runs into the Gloucester area and shot just wide on 26 minutes before being denied by a good Bath save from his volley a minute later. A 28th minute Hollis cross skimmed the crossbar and on 32 minutes a Foy free-kick found Ball unmarked but he curled wide from 6 yards out. Gloucester defender Adam Howarth made a crucial 33rd minute clearance for a corner with Ashby rushing into the area to meet Spencer's cross after he burst clear down the right. Ben Steane then lashed a half-cleared corner past Bath's post in the 38th minute before a good Gloucester break saw Tom Webb's strike from the right fall just inches wide of the mark.</p>
  <p>Halesowen were awarded a penalty with 45 minutes up on the first-half clock when Andy Hoskins bundled over Spencer on another run into the penalty area. However, the golden chance to break the deadlock was wasted when Bath made a great dive to his right to save Ashby's spot-kick under the cross-bar.</p>
  <p>Halesowen found it difficult to find the vital breakthrough after the penalty miss although Spencer turned to fire high in the 49th minute. Jimmy Cox had a 59th minute penalty appeal for hand-ball turned down and on the hour player manager Chris Burns delivered a dangerous free-kick into the Halesowen area. Bath then raced out to deny Spencer in the 65th minute when substitute Lee Smith deflected Asa Charlton's 25-yard shot. Bath was quick off his line again on 76 minutes to deny Spencer and kept out Steane's 25-yard shot two minutes later.</p>
  <p>The Tigers had their own chances to snatch the points with Sheils saving a free header from Cox on 77 minutes but a minute later lively Yeltz substitute Simon Forsdick played the ball for Spencer to earn a corner seconds after his introduction for the Yeltz. Cox then hit weakly across goal on 80 minutes when free on the right for the visitors.</p>
  <p>In the dying minutes, Bath made a tremendous flying save to deny a Ball volley on 82 minutes following another Spencer run and in injury time Gloucester substitute Adam Hemming broke down the left and forced Sheils to save with Burns heading the resulting corner over the bar.</p>

</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Vaughan; Colwell, Charlton, Smith, Jones, Baker, Hollis (Steane 68), Ashby (Spencer 68), Skidmore, Ball, Forsdick. Unused Subs: Grocutt, Foy, Sheils</p>
  <p>Walsall: Coleman; Willetts, Taylor, Stanley, Bennett, Emblen (Dann 65), Wright (Jameson 69), Lawrence, Hawley, Taylor, Matias (Harkness 64). Unused Subs: Platt, Wheeler</p>
  <p>Referee: K. Ingram (Kingswinford) Attendance: 258</p>
  <p>Halesowen flopped to their heaviest defeat in many seasons and were left chasing shadows as Walsall reserves strolled to victory with embarrassing ease.</p>
  <p>But it was the home side who created a few chances on goal in the opening quarter. Richard Ball sent a dipping 20-yard shot over the bar in the 10th minute and saw his 16th minute shot blocked by goalkeeper Dean Coleman after robbing Jamie Lawrence. Coleman then gathered a 17th minute cross from Dan Jones at the second attempt and Coleman saved from Ball on 23 minutes after a good pass from debut-boy Simon Forsdick.</p>
  <p>Walsall opened the floodgates in the 23rd minute with a simple goal after Karl Hawley fed Mark WRIGHT and a tame shot from the son of former-Yeltz favourite Evran Wright went through the hands of debut goalkeeper Nathan Vaughan from the edge of the area in a glaring error.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz never made a game of it from that point and fell two goals behind in the 32nd minute with a long ball falling for the unmarked HAWLEY to tap home from the edge of the 6-yard box.</p>
  <p>Forsdick broke clear on 35 minutes but wasted his chance and Walsall replied by going 3-0 ahead a minute before half-time when Vaughan failed to hold a Craig Stanley shot and Kris TAYLOR had another simple tap-in.</p>
  <p>Although the game was well and truly over by the break the humiliation had only just begun.</p>
  <p>Julian BENNETT fired home a fourth goal on 57 minutes from 15 yards following a Lawrence free-kick. Coleman blocked a Jones shot on the hour but a minute later Walsall walked in another goal when a Pedro Matias cross was kept in by Hawley and he crossed beyond Vaughan for WRIGHT to head home on the goal-line. Vaughan saved another decent chance from Hawley in the 62nd minute and then Hawley latched onto a through ball from Lawrence but his lob fell just wide after beating Vaughan.</p>
  <p>Andy Spencer and Ben Steane both looked lively after being introduced as Halesowen substitutes with Spencer's 71st minute flick forcing Coleman to tip away for a corner. Good work from Steane allowed Ball to shoot in the 77th minute and on 83 and 84 minutes Coleman held onto 20-yard shots from Steane and Spencer respectively.</p>
  <p>The visitors added two more goals in the last two minutes to coast into the semi-finals. Taylor picked up a rebound after a shot hit the Halesowen post on 88 minutes and his cross was turned into his own net by Richard COLWELL. A minute from full-time a cross from the right from Hawley was helped over the line by STANLEY to put Walsall in seventh heaven.</p>

  <p>Halesowen deserved their slender victory but had to wait for an own-goal two &#xD;
minutes from time in order to break the stalemate. With experienced central &#xD;
defender Colin Hoyle making his debut the Yeltz looked far more composed at the &#xD;
back than of late with Solihull proving to be ineffective in attack.</p>
  <p>
    In early exchanges Mark Sheils clawed away an 8 minute corner from &#xD;
Dave Haywood and two minutes later Andy Spencer volleyed just over Mark Gayle's &#xD;
crossbar at the other end. Jason Ashby then chipped a loose ball over the &#xD;
Solihull bar after Richard Ball charged down a 16 minute clearance.

blasted high from just 8 yards out. Jones then headed another Charlton free-kick &#xD;
just wide for the hosts a few seconds before the interval.</p>

    Morton Titteron curled just wide for Solihull at the start of the second half &#xD;
but it was Halesowen who continued to create most chances in the second half. &#xD;
Ball broke free on the right but lashed high on 67 minutes and David Foy hit a &#xD;
speculative 25-yard shot wide of the mark a minute later. Ben Steane produced a &#xD;
moment of midfield magic in the 70 minute allowing Spencer to cross &#xD;
but the Solihull defence scrambled clear from Ashby in front of goal. Ashby then &#xD;

minutes remaining. Steane cleverly side-stepped the ball in midfield allowing &#xD;
Foy to play the ball out to Hollis and when he volleyed across goal Martin HIER &#xD;
turned the ball into his own net from close range as he attempted to clear.</p>

    <h3>Shepshed P Yeltz P</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    The recent wet weather meant our game on Saturday at Shepshed was called off, but it wasn't too bad a day with Redditch dropping points again. The closeness of the league means we've dropped back to , but if we can put a consistent run together and win our games in hand we can still challenge for the title.
    
  </p>
  <p>Next Saturday we play Solihull Borough at The Grove - a game we need to win to keep in touch. They're one of the teams in contention for a top seven finish, so it's a very important game once again.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Cirencester 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    This crazy season took another turn for the better last night as the mighty Yeltz beat promotion rivals Cirencester 2-1 after trailing for most of the game. Late goals from Hollis and Charlton has taken us back up to , and with Rugby, Bromsgrove and Team Bath all drawing it was an excellent night. Full details in .
    
  </p>
  <p>On Saturday we travel to struggling Shepshed in another important game. They took a point off us at The Grove earlier in the season, and they way we're playing who knows what will happen. However, let's hope we can put a consistent run of form together from now until the end of the season.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Charlton, Grocutt, Jones, Spencer, Foy (Skidmore 87), Ashby, Ball, Steane, Hollis. Unused Subs: Smith, Baker, Forsdick, Vaughan.</p>
  <p>Cirencester Town: Thompson; Bird, McEntergart, Richards, Jackson (Bevan 84), Wootton, Robison, McCabe, Hopkins, Griffin, Fitch. Unused Subs: Davis, Wimble</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Edwards (Swadlincote) Attendance: 231 Booked: Ball (37), Grocutt (70), Wootton (77)</p>
  <p>Halesowen ended Cirencester's mammoth 15 game unbeaten sequence with a result that looked unlikely with just 15 minutes remaining.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz started where they left off on Saturday and failed to produce a clear strike on goal in another poor first-half performance. By contrast, the well-organised visitors won a series of early corners and Andy McCabe delivered a 9th minute corner kick for Scott Griffin to head onto the top of the bar with McCabe crossing the ball back again to scrape the far post seconds later.</p>
  <p>Cirencester went on to take a simple 18th minute lead with the unmarked Gareth HOPKINS rising to head home a left wing cross from six yards. Home goalkeeper Mark Sheils then did well to save when Hopkins turned to shoot on the half-hour.</p>
  <p>Halesowen made a much brighter start to the second half with the solid Cirencester defence clearing under pressure from Asa Charlton in the 47th minute from a Simon Hollis cross. On 65 minutes Halesowen created their best chance of the game so far when Ben Steane flicked a header on for Jason Ashby to cross and the ball fell to Charlton but he blasted high from 12 yards out.</p>
  <p>Cirencester's strategy of sitting back with their solid defence shutting-up shop for the evening seemed to be paying off until Halesowen finally found a 74th minute equaliser when Richard Ball's shot rebounded off the legs of goalkeeper Paul Thompson and HOLLIS followed up to drive home from 12 yards.</p>
  <p>Cirencester immediately came out of their shell and broke down the other end with Hopkins getting the better of Dan Jones to become free down the right but the home defence somehow escaped a game of pinball in their own area. Halesowen's Ashby was then fouled on the edge of the Cirencester penalty area by Gary Wootton who received a yellow card and CHARLTON drove the 78th minute free-kick through a crowd of players into the bottom corner of the net to give the Yeltz the lead.</p>
  <p>Ashby had a decent call for a penalty turned down but Cirencester poured forward to try to save the game in the dying moments. Hopkins took the ball down just six yards out in the 86th minute but Sheils stood up to make a fine blocking save. Sheils then made a weak 88th minute clearance that fell directly for Ben Fitch to unleash a 35-yard shot but the ball struck the post with Sheils frantically back-tracking. In the final minute frustrated Cirencester struck the woodwork for the fourth time when a Hopkins header crashed off the underside of the bar and the ball was once again scrambled clear.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 0 Evesham 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>We missed an excellent chance to move closer to the top when we put in what sounds like a pretty poor performance in losing 2-0 at home to Evesham. Two early goals meant we failed to take advantage of both Redditch and Rugby drawing, and first place is looking increasingly a long way off.</p>
  <p>
    We've slipped down to  now, but still have games in hand on everyone above us but Cirencester. If we assume we're playing for a spot in the top 7, then it looks like there's only 9 teams in it and we're very well placed.

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell (Ball 57), Charlton, Grocutt, Jones, Baker, Hollis, Ashby, Piearce, Steane, N. Smith (Skidmore 57). Unused Subs: Small, Lowry, Vaughan</p>
  <p>Evesham United: T. Clarke; A. Smith, Burrow, Knight, Khela, Pinkney, Flynn, Marsh, Pountney (J. Clarke 65), Ross, Nicholls (Shaw 65). Unused Subs: Guest, West</p>
  <p>Referee: W. Ramsay (Coventry) Attendance: 530 Booked: None Sponsors' Man of the Match: None selected</p>
  <p>In-form Evesham reaped the harvest of some sloppy Halesowen defending to claim two first half goals and ruin Halesowen's unbeaten home league record into the bargain.</p>
  <p>Tim Clarke collected a Lewis Baker header in the 5th minute and two minutes later Mark Sheils punched clear a Craig Nicholls free-kick at the other end. Steve Piearce then beat Tim Clarke to the ball in the 8th minute but with Piearce forced wide the Evesham goalkeeper was able to recover.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen looking fragile in defence and lacking a wise head in midfield, former favourite Sean Flynn was able to dictate play and ex-goalkeeper Tim Clarke enjoyed a largely redundant afternoon for the Robins against a bumper home crowd.</p>
  <p>The visitors were handed a 12th minute lead when a mix-up between full-back Richard Colwell and goalkeeper Mark Sheils saw COLWELL gently head a through ball from Sean Flynn past his own advancing goalkeeper with the ball trickling agonisingly over the line.</p>
  <p>With the Yeltz continuing to blow hot and cold from one week to another, Craig Pountney helped the ball on for another former Yeltz player Lee ROSS to touch home Evesham's second goal from inside the 6-yard box on 17 minutes with the ball again trickling over the line. Sheils then gathered a 26th minute header from Pountney and made an acrobatic save to deny the unmarked Grant Pinkney nine minutes later. Two minutes before half-time Baker headed wide from an Asa Charlton cross for Halesowen.</p>
  <p>Ben Steane had one of the better performances for the out-of-sorts Yeltz and made a dazzling 50-yard run from his own half in the 51st minute before being brought down on the edge of the Evesham box by Lee Knight - but Simon Hollis could only hit the resulting free-kick tamely at Tim Clarke. Lewis Baker headed wide on 58 minutes and Halesowen's best chance fell in the 72nd minute when Hollis combined with substitute Richard Ball to force Clarke into a diving save.</p>
  <p>Evesham remain unbeaten for seven games in 2004 and Ross almost added insult to injury with two minutes remaining but struck the Halesowen crossbar with a curling shot from 20 yards.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 6 Swindon Supermarine 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty yeltz kicked off the second half of their league campaign with an emphatic 6-0 victory over Swindon Supermarine. With both Redditch and Rugby losing, we've made up some important ground at the top of the .
    
  </p>
  <p>Jason started things off with two first half goals - his first for eight games - before second half goals from Spencer, Steane, Frazer McHugh (back whilst looking for another club) and Baker turned it into something of a rout.</p>
  <p>Next Saturday Evesham are the visitors to The Grove. They're on a pretty decent run at the moment including beating Redditch, but it's important we continue our run of victories.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Charlton (Small 66), Grocutt (Smith 64), Jones, Baker (Skidmore 70), Hollis, Ashby, Spencer, McHugh, Steane. Unused Subs: Lowry, Vaughan</p>
  <p>Swindon Supermarine: King; Toomey, Futcher, Bennett, McCluskey (Grainge 62), Copp, Edwards, Terry, Carter (Gee 76), Miller, Matthews (Blastland 62). Unused Subs: Slattery, Gill</p>
  <p>Referee: P. Martin (Wellingborough) Attendance: 436 Booked: Carter (71) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Simon Hollis</p>
  <p>Halesowen smashed Swindon for six of the best with ex-Bradford City midfielder Fraser McHugh running the show from midfield in a devastating display of quality finishing.</p>
  <p>In a lively opening Jason Ashby picked up a poor clearance from Swindon goalkeeper Tom King in the 4th minute but turned to fire just wide. Justin Miller headed across the Halesowen goal in the 10th minute but it was McHugh who set up Andy Spencer to strike a ten yard shot off the Swindon crossbar in the 10th minute. Home goalkeeper Mark Sheils then made a good save from Justin Miller and Jimmy Carter in the 25th minute after the Swindon forwards picked up a loose ball.</p>
  <p>League-leading marksman Ashby then set Halesowen on their way with two goals within ninety seconds. On 28 minutes ASHBY latched onto a poor defensive header to beat King with a cheeky chip from 18-yards. McHugh then played a splendid ball through to Ben Steane and he crossed for ASHBY to head home a second goal from five yards in the 30th minute. Five minutes before half-time Sheils protected Halesowen's lead by gathering a 25-yard free-kick from Simon Futcher.</p>
  <p>STEANE added a third goal to remember for the Yeltz in the 51st minute when he won the ball in midfield and unleashed a magnificent powerful, dipping shot into the top corner of the net from 35-yards to the gasping delight of the home crowd. With the home side running riot, the unmarked McHUGH made it 4-0 a minute later by cracking home into the bottom corner from 10-yards. The rampant Yeltz made it three goals in three minutes in a superb 54th minute break with Simon Hollis playing the ball out to Ashby and SPENCER raced into the area to convert the cross from close range.</p>
  <p>In continuing waves of attacks, King blocked a Spencer shot in the 55th minute and Lewis Baker headed Asa Charlton's corner onto the roof of the net four minutes later. BAKER increased the misery of ex-Chippenham manager Tommy Saunders in his first game in charge of Swindon by rifling home a sixth home goal in the 63rd minute when unmarked in the penalty area.</p>
  <p>Spencer's shot was turned around the post in the 65th minute but the game finally calmed down after a series of late substitutions. King gathered a 20-yard drive from Hollis in the 74th minute and in the final minute Sheils tipped a cross-shot from Futcher over the bar. Seconds later Ashby almost added a seventh goal but headed Steane's cross wide in front of goal, although enough had already been done to erase the painful memory of the four-goal defeat at Swindon earlier in the season.</p>
