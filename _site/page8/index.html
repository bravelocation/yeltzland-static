    <h3>BSC 3R  Yeltz 1 Rushall 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz took another step on the road to glory with a brilliant 1-0 victory over Rushall. The 172 people who braved the weather were delighted when Simon Hollis got the winner near the end to prevent extra-time which took us into the quarter-finals where we meet Walsall at home. Full details in Dave's match report.</p>
  <p>We start a run of 3 home league games on Saturday when Swindon Supermarine visit The Grove. They stuffed us at their place, and have just appointed a new manager I believe, so who knows what's going to happen.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Colwell, Small, Grocutt, Jones, Baker, Hollis, Lowry, Ball, Steane, Skidmore. Unused Subs: N. Smith, Spencer, Ashby, Charlton, Sheils</p>
  <p>Rushall Olympic: Cooke; White (Wright 82), Coates, Dyer, Brown, Vassell, Walters, Bishop, M. Holdcroft, Maragh, B. Smith. Unused Subs: R. Holdcroft, Ashton, Whitehouse, Watson</p>
  <p>Referee: C. Nock (Stourbridge)         Attendance: 172         Booked: Wright (90)</p>
  <p>Halesowen struggled into the next round with a late winner denying Rushall's determined performance.</p>
  <p>Richard Ball headed wide after 4 minutes but half-hearted Halesowen offered little else in a scrappy first half with uncompromising Rushall creating the better chances. On 29 minutes Aaron Bishop hit a half-volley just past Matt Lowe's post and a minute later Danny Coates did well down the left but his cross was fortunately cleared by Mark Lowry. Lowe then made a crucial goal-line save low down to deny Mark Holdcroft from a 20-yard free-kick in the 40th minute. Greg Walters almost put Kirk Maragh clear in the box in the 43rd minute and a minute before the break Lowe dived to keep out another Mark Holdcroft effort with the visitors on top.</p>
  <p>In the second half, Ball fed Simon Hollis in the 53rd minute but visiting goalkeeper Paul Cooke turned his chip over the bar for a corner and Ball then almost caught Cooke off his line in the 63rd minute with a long 40-yard effort.</p>
  <p>Rushall continued to show the greater fight and on 66 minutes Lowe saved at the feet of Maragh. The visitors' luck was out in the 75th minute when Ben Smith beat Lowe from 20-yards but the ball rebounded off the inside of the post. With extra-time looming, HOLLIS tapped home Halesowen's winner after Ball's 10-yard shot cannoned off the post from Lowry's pass into the penalty area.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz now meet Walsall at the Grove in the quarter-finals.</p>

    <h3>Cinderford P Yeltz P</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The recent wet weather caused the game down in Cinderford to be called off. However it wasn't too bad a day with several other results going our way somewhat.</p>
  <p>
    Despite Redditch only drawing and Gloucester losing again, we're down to  with Cirencester looking the main hope to catch Redditch at the moment. They lost their first 4 games, so it's been an amazing run of 12 wins and 2 draws since.

  <p>We start a run of 4 home games on Tuesday against lowly Rushall Olympic in the B'ham Senior Cup before Swindon Supermarine visit The Grove on Saturday.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 1 Sutton Coldfield 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    Halesowen gained their first victory in what seems like ages when we beat Sutton Coldfield 1-0 through a second half Lewis Baker goal. More details in .
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Charlton, Grocutt (Small 80), Smith, Baker (Skidmore 88), Spencer, Ashby, Piearce, Steane, Ball (Reece 90). Unused Subs: Lowry, Lowe</p>
  <p>Sutton Coldfield Town: Bray; Wolsey, Gardner, Geohaghan, Farmer (Spittle 56), Jones (Duley 73), Peters (Turner 83), Watkins, Carter, Perrow, Martin. Unused Subs: Ling, Carpenter</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Hamilton (Cheltenham) Attendance: 392 Booked: Watkins (39), Perrow (44), Colwell (47), Carter (75) Sponsors' Man of the Match: Asa Charlton</p>
  <p>Sutton proved to be a tough nut to crack despite Halesowen playing their prolific three-man forward line in an adventurous line-up.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz were happy to keep a clean sheet after leaking nine goals in their previous three games and they kept highly rated youngster Exodus Geohoghan quiet all afternoon.</p>
  <p>Ben Steane struck a 4th minute half-volley over the bar and two minutes later Jason Ashby made a splendid run down the right only to see his cross turned away for a corner. Sutton won their first corner in the 15th minute after good work from Dean Perrow and centre-forward Nicky Carter then lashed a 25-yard drive wide in the 18th minute. Steane ran on from midfield but chipped weakly at goal in the 23rd minute and in even exchanges Richie Gardner hit over the bar in the 28th minute for the visitors. Gardner's dangerous cross was then headed away by Lewis Baker in the 33rd minute. Six minutes before the interval Baker headed a long Asa Charlton free-kick across the Sutton goal but the visiting defence cleared with Ashby about to pounce near the goal-line.</p>
  <p>Two minutes after the restart home goalkeeper Mark Sheils tipped a 25-yard free-kick from Mark Wolsey around the post for a corner and six minutes later an Ashby cross put Steve Piearce clear but he hesitated in front of goal allowing the Royals to tidy up.</p>
  <p>Halesowen hit the solitary winning goal on 56 minutes when Charlton delivered an in-swinging right-wing corner for BAKER to rise through a crowd of players and head home from close range. Baker then shot just wide from 20-yards in the 69th minute but it was the hard-working and well organised Sutton Coldfield who made the late running after Darren Grocutt went off with a 78th minute head injury.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen defending deeply, Carter struck the side-netting in the 84th minute but the hosts held on for an important three points.</p>

    <h3>Bromsgrove 3 Yeltz 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz were disappointed to throw away a two goal lead to fellow promotion candidates Bromsgrove Rovers, but in the end were happy to gain a point with a late equaliser.</p>
  <p>We took the lead early on through a Neil Smith cracker and then went further ahead through Steve Pie-arce. Then somehow we allowed them to score three after the break, but Stevo poached a second to share the points.</p>
  <p>Saturday brings Sutton Coldfield to The Grove in another important game at the top of the table. We haven't played half of our games yet so there's all to play for, but we really need to start picking up some victories before Redditch are completely out of sight.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Bromsgrove Rovers: Wyatt; Frost, Hillman, Pope, Benton, Beckett, Jackson, Allen (Bowen 53), Szewczyk, Benbow, Banner. Unused Subs: Gandy, Hughes, Sutton, Atkinson</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Colwell, Charlton, Smith, Jones, Baker, Hollis (Small 55), Ashby (Ball 60), Piearce, Steane, Spencer. Unused Subs: Skidmore, Reece, Lowe</p>
  <p>Referee: G. O'Sullivan (Basingstoke) Attendance: 898 Booked: Spencer (34), Baker (34), Frost (34), Pope (90)</p>
  <p>Halesowen appeared to be coasting to victory but then had to rescue a point after their fragile defence allowed Bromsgrove to score three second half-goals from set pieces.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz made a dream start in the 3rd minute when Ben Steane turned a left-wing corner into the path of Neil SMITH and he cracked a 25-yard drive into the top corner of the net. On 9 minutes Bromsgrove striker Paul Szewczyk turned well in the box but Mark Sheils made a half-save with his defence clearing the danger. Bromsgrove then forced two corners in the 20th minute and Marcus Jackson hit a speculative 30-yard drive over the bar on the half-hour but the first half firmly belonged to Halesowen with their neat passing play.</p>
  <p>The visitors added a second goal in the 33rd minute when Andy Spencer was put clear on the left and although Jason Ashby was unable to fully connect with the cross, Ashby played the ball on for Steve PIEARCE to net from six yards out. Four minutes before half-time Simon Hollis then hooked a cross for Spencer to force a finger-tip save from home goalkeeper Paul Wyatt.</p>
  <p>The game took a dramatic turn-around in the second-half as Halesowen sat back to let the hosts off the hook after they introduced substitute forward Sam Bowen in the 53rd minute. Jackson struck the angle of the post and cross-bar from the right on the hour before Bromsgrove pulled a goal back in the 61st minute when Lewis BAKER headed into his own net as he attempted to clear Kevin Banner's cross. Four minutes later Bromsgrove levelled against the odds with Grant BECKETT hammering home a direct 22-yard free-kick into the top-corner of the net. Richard Colwell then cleared off his goal-line in the 70th minute but Halesowen were caught out yet again from a set-piece for the home side's third goal in the 81st minute as JACKSON dispatched a quickly taken 20-yard free-kick into the top corner.</p>
  <p>Halesowen rescued a point in the 84th minute when Wyatt failed to gather Asa Charlton's 25-yard shot and PIEARCE pounced to hit home the rebound from close range. Substitute Richard Ball then won the ball in midfield a minute later but lobbed the ball over the bar with both sides looking for a winner to close the gap on runaway league-leaders Redditch.</p>

    <h3>Yeltz 2 Stourport 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>Brief news (and late) as I'm away on holiday I'm afraid.</p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz came back from 2-0 down to gain a point at home to Stourport Swifts, although we were disappointed not to gain all three points. Poor marking led to us being two down after not very long, but we got one back after Dominic Reece was allowed to nudge their keeper into the net. New bloke Richard Ball came on to mark an impressive debut with an equaliser, but we couldn't get a winner.</p>
  <p>Our next games are against the two teams directly below us in the table - Bromsgrove away on New Year's Day and then Sutton Coldfield at home on Saturday.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Reece (Small 72), Charlton, Grocutt (Ball 59), Jones, Baker, Hollis, Ashby, Piearce, Steane, Spencer. Unused Subs: Colwell, Skidmore, Sheils</p>
  <p>Stourport Swifts: Evans; Mark Jones, Ulfig, Powell, Davies, Jukes, Cotterill, Sayer (Giddings 48), Kavanagh, Dunn, Wright (Webb 72). Unused Subs: Mark A. Jones, Harris, Price</p>
  <p>Referee: C. D. Nock (Stourbridge) Attendance: 584 Booked: Hollis (87), Giddings (87)</p>
  <p>Richard Ball rescued under-performing Halesowen with a second-half debut goal after ex-Halesowen midfielder Richard Kavanagh put the Swifts in the driving-seat by setting up two early goals from set pieces.</p>
  <p>Dan Jones hit wide for Halesowen from 20-yards in the 4th minute before the Swifts raced into a two-goal lead. Kavanagh hit a twice-taken low free-kick into the Halesowen area and Ronnie SAYER was first to react to clip the ball into the top-corner from 6-yards in the 14th minute. The misfiring Yeltz failed to defend another dead-ball kick when Kavanagh delivered a right-wing corner in the 25th minute allowing Nathan JUKES to head home directly on his debut to stun the home crowd.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen gradually waking up, a 26th minute header from Dominic Reece found Jason Ashby in front of goal but goalkeeper Lee Evans was able to make a close range save. Stourport played Andrew Wright as a sole front-runner and were always going to be difficult to break down, so it was somewhat out-of-the-blue when Halesowen pulled a goal back in the 29th minute. Simon Hollis miscued a right-wing cross and REECE rose with goalkeeper Evans appearing to push the ball into his own net under pressure before being bundled over by Reece, with furious calls from the visitors for a foul.</p>
  <p>At the other end, home goalkeeper Matt Lowe spilt a 30-yard drive from Sayer but Charlton tidied up to concede a 38th minute corner. Halesowen were then fortunate to escape a penalty appeal seconds before half-time when Wright pounced on confusion between Darren Grocutt and Lowe and appeared to be brought down - although the referee waved play on.</p>
  <p>Ashby almost equalised for the Yeltz two minutes after the re-start when he controlled a long kick from Lowe but put the ball wide of the net from eight yards. Evans then held onto a 53rd minute drive from Asa Charlton.</p>
  <p>Substitute Richard BALL, signed only a few days earlier from Stourport on a two-year contract, was introduced in the 59th minute and made an immediate impact to level the scores six minutes later by latching onto a bad back-header and calmly slotting past Evans from 12-yards.</p>
  <p>Kerry Giddings and Jukes struck just wide for Stourport after 67 and 70 minutes, but it was Halesowen who peppered the visiting goal in the latter stages with their enviable forward line of Ball, Ashby and Steve Piearce all going close. Ben Steane hit just over the bar in the 75th minute and two minutes later Hollis beat two defenders before striking his shot inches high from 30-yards out.</p>
  <p>In the final two minutes Charlton hit over the bar from a Lewis Baker header and Piearce struck wide but without any real structure or pattern to Halesowen's play, the Swifts were able to hold out for a draw.</p>

    <h3>Mangotsfield 4 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    They'd lost five on the trot, we were on an excellent run and we'd beat them 6-0 at home, but unbelievably the mighty Yeltz lost 4-0 away to Mangotsfield. It sounds like a pretty dismal performance - read for yourselves in  if you can stand it.
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Mangotsfield Utd: Greaves; Patchet (Kemp 52), Drysdale, Hendy, Summers, Loydon, Sims, Lee, Edwards (Pitcher 75), Seal, Haines. Unused Sub: Warren</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Reece, Charlton, Smith (Small 69), Jones, Baker, Hollis, Ashby, Spencer, Steane, Skidmore (Lowry 69). Unused Subs: Grocutt, Sheils</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Cassidy (Weston-Super-Mare) Attendance: 251</p>
  <p>Halesowen's wafer-thin squad performed well below par and slumped to their worst defeat of the season in a pre-Christmas horror-show in north Bristol. Mangotsfield had lost their previous six home matches but still thumped four goals past Halesowen without reply to give their new manager Martyn Grimshaw his first win in charge.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz were never in contention and fell behind after just four minutes when Dominic Reece sliced his attempted clearance allowing Danny Haines to cross for Darren EDWARDS to force the ball into the net despite the best efforts of Simon Hollis to clear off the line. Visiting goalkeeper Matt Lowe saved at full stretch from Edwards three minutes later and Halesowen escaped again in the 10th minute when Haines stole in behind their defence but headed wide. Leading marksman David Seal then broke clear in the 12th minute but blasted high.</p>
  <p>Hollis finally produced a 15-yard shot on goal for Halesowen in the 13th minute but goalkeeper Danny Greaves saved with his legs. Seal then back-headed a Gareth Loydon corner over the bar and hit high again a minute later. Halesowen forced their first corner on the half-hour and a minute later Andy Spencer's cross from the right was cleared.</p>
  <p>However, the Yeltz fell two goals behind in the 34th minute with their defensive frailty exposed again after failing to clear another right-wing corner from Haines and Mark SUMMERS rose to head home.</p>
  <p>In the 39th minute a Lewis Baker shot was palmed away by Greaves with Reece hitting the inviting rebound wide and Ben Steane curled a 20-yard free-kick over the bar a minute after the restart.</p>
  <p>But Mangotsfield were gifted a third goal to kill the game in the 51st minute when Neil Smith passed directly to Seal and he ran on to put the unmarked EDWARDS clear on goal to score with a cheeky chip. Smith then failed to convert a Steane cross in front of goal after 57 minutes before clearing up from Adam Sims at the other end. With out-of-sorts Halesowen finally showing some late promise, a long throw-in from Hollis found Baker near goal but he was unable to turn to shoot. Edwards almost completed his Mangotsfield hat-trick on 70 minutes after Halesowen's defence was carved open again but he struck wide from 15-yards.</p>
  <p>In the 77th minute the home side failed to clear a Reece cross but Spencer ballooned the ball high over the bar from 12-yards. Greaves then grabbed a 20-yard shot from Steane at the second attempt and young substitute Mark Lowry fired high with four minutes remaining.</p>
  <p>Halesowen's dreadful day was completed in the last minute with substitute Jack PITCHER turning home a right-wing cross from six yards to finally avenge Mangotsfield's 6-0 defeat at The Grove earlier in the season.</p>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz moved up to  with an impressive 3-1 victory over Taunton. Despite going behind early on, we came back with two from Simon Hollis and another from the happily available Steve Pie-arce in a fine display of attacking football.
    
  </p>
  <p>On Saturday our last game before Xmas takes us down to Mangotsfield. They're on an awful run of form, so let's hope we can continue our good run and continue the chase after the leaders.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Reece, Charlton, Smith, Jones, Skidmore (Hallam 80), Hollis, Ashby (Colwell 89), Piearce, Steane, Spencer. Unused Subs: Small, Baker, Sheils</p>
  <p>Taunton Town: Edwards; Sheppard (Taswell 61), Dicks, Duff, Watson, Kelly, Fields, Douglas (West 80), Foster, Harris, Fisher. Unused Subs: Peckham, Mogg</p>
  <p>Referee: P. Thompson (Chesterfield)             Attendance: 294</p>
  <p>Halesowen climbed into 3rd place in the league after fighting back from behind with their exciting brand of attacking football.</p>
  <p>Taunton started brightly and forced four consecutive corners in the first minute with home goalkeeper Matt Lowe tipping the ball over the bar from Gary Fisher. Grantley Dicks then struck a 20-yard free-kick inches over the Halesowen bar in the 12th minute before Danny HARRIS gave the visitors an 18th minute lead when he planted a header down into the Halesowen net from close range from Tom Kelly's dangerous right-wing corner. A half-volley from Dicks then rolled past the post before the Yeltz clicked into gear.</p>
  <p>On 23 minutes Jason Ashby did well to win the ball on the left and he crossed for Simon Hollis but he volleyed wide when clear on goal. HOLLIS then equalised in the 27th minute with a super 25-yard strike that left goalkeeper Paul Edwards floundering. A minute later Andy Spencer's cross took a looping deflection and almost beat the back-tracking Edwards.</p>
  <p>After the half-time break, Ben Steane worked through a packed Taunton defence and set up Hollis to drive just wide. Taunton were increasingly pushed back into their own half although Matt Lowe grabbed a good corner-kick from Martin Douglas on the break in the 55th minute. Steve Piearce curled just wide in the 57th minute from the edge of the area before HOLLIS powered home a left-wing cross from Dominic Reece with a perfect header into the top corner in the 59th minute to put Halesowen ahead.</p>
  <p>With Halesowen looking increasingly dangerous, a pacy break from defence in the 64th minute saw Ashby dash down the right and set up the in-rushing Hollis looking for his hat-trick but he hit the side-netting when free in the penalty area. Edwards then turned away a goal-bound 25-yard screamer from Steane for a corner a minute later.</p>
  <p>Steve PIEARCE added a third goal in the 75th minute to maintain Halesowen's eight-game unbeaten league run with a bullet header from a Hollis corner leaving Edwards well beaten again. Edwards then held onto Piearce's 15-yard shot in the 83rd minute and substitute Mark Hallam should have added a fourth goal two minutes from time but struck Steane's cross wide from ten yards.</p>

    <p>
  <p>
    Prodigal son Steve Piearce made an excellent return to The Grove with two second half goals in a 3-0 win over Clevedon. With Pie-arce and Jason up front I reckon we'd be a match for anyone in this league, but I'm not sure exactly what Steve's availability is - if anyone knows can they let us know on ?
    
  </p>
  <p>After being rightly nagged for not updating it sooner, there's a new vote on the site for your Xmas pleasure.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Reece, Charlton, Grocutt, Jones, N. Smith (Lowry 78), &#xD;
Hollis (Colwell 78), Ashby, Piearce, Steane, Spencer. Unused Subs: Hallam, &#xD;
Small, Sheils</p>

  <p>Referee: I. Smedley (Derby) Attendance: 386 Booked: None Sponsors' Man of the Match: Simon Hollis</p>
  <p>Former favourite Steve Piearce made a dream return to the Grove with two goals &#xD;
in a comfortable Halesowen victory. Piearce notched over fifty goals in two &#xD;
seasons at Halesowen in the late 1990s before moving to Hereford and already &#xD;
looks to have formed a formidable forward partnership with goal-machine Jason &#xD;
Ashby, already on 23 goals for the season.</p>
  <p>However, Halesowen started shakily with Darren Grocutt tidying up a goalmouth &#xD;
scramble in the 5th minute with Clevedon's Fidel Richards eventually &#xD;
striking wide. From that point on there was only one winner as Clevedon failed &#xD;
to create any meaningful chances for the rest of the game.</p>
  <p>Paul Treago was on top form early on in the Clevedon goal keeping out a fierce &#xD;
7th minute drive from 15 yards by Jason Ashby after Ben Steane laid &#xD;
off the ball. Piearce and Ashby then combined five minutes later with Ashby &#xD;
flicking the ball off for Piearce to force another fine save from Treago. A &#xD;
Steane shot flashed wide on 13 minutes and Andy Spencer made a long run from &#xD;
midfield in the 14th minute but he hit wide with better options &#xD;
available.</p>
  <p>It was no surprise when Dan JONES rose at the far post to squeeze a header into &#xD;
the net from a Simon Hollis corner to give the Yeltz a 26th minute &#xD;
lead. Clevedon then made a double substitution in attack but the move had little &#xD;
effect and it was Halesowen who finished the first half strongly with Neil Smith &#xD;
shooting wide on 42 minutes and Spencer almost latching onto a through ball from &#xD;
Steane just before the break.</p>
  <p>Spencer won an early second half corner before Halesowen deservedly increased &#xD;
their lead in the 53rd minute when Steane made a long solo run from &#xD;
midfield and set up PIEARCE to turn on the penalty spot and fire past Treago &#xD;
from 12 yards. Ashby then set up Steane on the hour but he screwed wide from 15 &#xD;
yards out.</p>
  <p>In a rare counter-attack, a casual back header from Jones almost let in &#xD;
Clevedon's Ryan Weisburg in the 67th minute but the under-worked &#xD;
goalkeeper Matt Lowe did just enough to distract the substitute striker. With &#xD;
little else on offer from the visitors Hollis blasted over the bar in the &#xD;
68th minute and then saw his shot blocked on the line five minutes &#xD;
later with Piearce forcing a corner from the rebound. From the corner a &#xD;
wide-angled shot from Hollis beat the Clevedon defence and PIEARCE was on hand &#xD;
to convert his second goal from close range in the 73rd minute. In &#xD;
the final ten minutes Halesowen introduced 18-year youngster Mark Lowry who had &#xD;
only just made the move from Stafford Rangers.</p>

  <p>Our next game now is on Saturday back at the Grove against Chesham.</p>

Sponsors' Halesowen Town Man of the Match: Ian Cooper</p>
  <p>Early Christmas gifts were handed out as Halesowen surrendered their unbeaten home record in an unhappy return to the Grove after weeks on the road.</p>
  <p>Halesowen made a dreadful start by falling behind in the 3rd minute when the defence was caught napping and failed to clear Mark Bridge's cross allowing Shane HILL's shot to creep home.</p>
  <p>The flowing football and promise of earlier in the season was lacking and it was the cash-strapped Canaries who displayed great team spirit to record their first win under new manager Darren Salton. Halesowen did still create the main chances but their finishing was woefully off-target on the day. Simon Forsdick volleyed over the bar in the 17th minute after Alex Cowley won a corner and Forsdick then put Richard Burgess free two minutes later but he missed the target from 15 yards. Hitchin goalkeeper Richard Wilmot easily collected a couple of 34th minute crosses from Forsdick and Dan Jones and on 39 minutes Burgess flicked the ball on for out-of-form Jason Moore to slice wide in front of goal. A minute before the interval Forsdick was wayward again from 12 yards when put through by Nick Amos.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz continued to struggle in the second half and it was Hitchin substitute Bilal Hassan who cut in from the left to fire just wide on 49 minutes. Sponsors' man of the match Ian Cooper then cleared a dangerous 52nd minute Bridge cross with Hill set to pounce.</p>
  <p>Hitchin increased their lead in the 61st minute when the persistence of Darren HAY helped him surge into the area and shrug off half-hearted challenges from the home defence and goalkeeper Chris Taylor to bundle the ball home from close range. Two minutes later Taylor was almost caught out again by Hay breaking down the left but managed to claw the ball away.</p>
  <p>On 64 minutes Moore headed weakly at visiting goalkeeper Wilmot and six minutes later Wilmot juggled the ball from a Burgess cross with Forsdick closing in. Wilmot then produced a fine 74th minute save when Forsdick at last struck a shot on target for Halesowen as the hosts won three successive corners. Amos then headed a cross from Forsdick over the bar in front of goal after 77 minutes.</p>
  <p>More misery followed for Halesowen as Hitchin went 3-0 ahead in the 81st minute when Aaran CAVILL was left free to drill home a rebound from the edge of the area after Taylor made a good blocking save from Bridge with only Hitchin's fourth attempt on target.</p>
  <p>Captain Steve POPE headed home an 83rd minute consolation goal from Dave Haywood's right-wing corner but it was too little, too late. In the dying minutes Forsdick's late effort was disallowed after Cowley barged into Wilmot and Wilmot blocked from Burgess in front of goal in injury time.</p>

    <h3>WSC  Evesham 0 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz stormed into the WSC semi-finals with a 2-0 win away to Evesham. Despite Evesham playing ex-Yeltz stars Tim Clarke and Sean Flynn, second half goals from Jason and Hallam clinched the victory.</p>
  <p>
    On Saturday  visit The Grove back in the League. They lost 4-2 at home to Evesham, so you would think we have a half-decent chance of picking up some points here (I know I'm being very cautious!).
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Evesham United: Clarke; A. Smith, Sage (Pryce 60), Burrow, Bailey, Pinkney, Flynn, Nicholls, Hammet (Christie 81), Ball, Khela. Unused Subs: West, Oakey</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Colwell, Charlton, N. Smith, Jones, Baker (J. Skidmore HT (Grocutt 74)), Hollis (Phillips HT), Ashby, Hallam, S. Skidmore, Small. Unused Sub: Steane</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Scarr (Rubery) Booked: None</p>
  <p>Worcestershire Senior Cup holders Halesowen progressed to this season's semi-final with their bare-bones squad notching two second-half goals on a rock-hard frozen surface.</p>
  <p>Evesham named ex-Halesowen favourites Tim Clarke and Sean Flynn in their line-up and in the 5th minute Clarke made a blocking save from Simon Hollis. The home side had the better of the first half with goalkeeper Matt Lowe taking out a cross from Grant Pinkney in the 9th minute. Flynn then met a Craig Nicholls cross but his header flew just wide on 11 minutes. Craig Ball took the first corner of the match for Evesham in the 23rd minute but Mark Hallam headed clear. Ball's 30-yard free-kick then took a deflection three minutes later but Lowe palmed the ball away with Pinkney hitting over the bar from the resulting corner. Flynn then hit wide from the edge of the area on the half-hour before Bryan Small drove wide from Halesowen's first corner in the 32nd minute. Ten minutes before the break Clarke touched a Hollis shot for another Halesowen corner.</p>
  <p>The second half belonged to Halesowen with half-time substitute Kelvin Phillips showing some neat touches. Phillips crossed for Hallam to head wide after 53 minutes before winning a 60th minute corner. Phillips then produced a 63rd minute overhead flick for fellow substitute Josh Skidmore to challenge Clarke and the ball fell for the league-leading marksman Jason ASHBY to hit home the opening goal from five yards. With Halesowen in control Hallam put Ashby clear on 69 minutes but he lobbed the ball high over the bar when faced with Clarke.</p>
  <p>Evesham's last chance to retrieve the game fell in the 80th minute but Inderpaul Khela volleyed inches wide. The Yeltz added a second goal four minutes from time when Small played the ball out to Richard Colwell on the right wing and he delivered a fine cross for HALLAM to rise above the Evesham defence and firmly head home. A minute from time another Phillips flick fed Ashby on the right but his cross was cut out by the Evesham defence.</p>

    <h3>Team Bath 1 Yeltz 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>The mighty Yeltz came away from a depressing Team Bath ground with a hard fought but well deserved victory. We were always in control and took the lead through an excellent move finished off through Jason. They equalised from a penalty, but then we regained the lead through Jason's second and despite some late pressure we took all three points.</p>
  <p>
    Full details in , and I'll maybe write about the view from the grassy knoll when I've received security clearance.
    
  </p>
  <p>On Tuesday we travel to Evesham in the Worcester Senior Cup, before hosting Clevedon next Saturday back at The Grove.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Team Bath: Hines; D. Smith, Watson, Nichols (Canham 71), Ball, Tilson, Gillingham (Maye 85), Saunders, Paul Tisdale, Reeves (Lewis 61), Prince. Unused Subs: Peter Tisdale, Parkin</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Skidmore, Charlton, Grocutt (N. Smith 70), Jones, Baker, Hollis, Ashby, Spencer, Steane, Reece. Unused Subs: Colwell, Small, Sheils</p>
  <p>Referee: M. Halford (Bristol) Attendance: 101 (Inside Ground)  4 (Outside Ground) Booked: Jones (90)</p>
  <p>Jason Ashby may have been Halesowen's only recognised forward available but the star striker hit two more goals to boost Halesowen's drive up the table.</p>
  <p>Team Bath were looking for revenge for their FA Trophy exit earlier in the season but it was Halesowen who were first on the attack with a Simon Hollis free-kick being cleared by goalkeeper Ali Hines in the 8th minute. At the other end, Matt Lowe punched clear a Luke Price corner in the 13th minute and after 16 minutes Ashby almost latched onto another Hollis free-kick. Dean Smith then flashed a shot across the Halesowen goal before the visitors gained the upper hand.</p>
  <p>ASHBY gave Halesowen a 24th minute lead by converting Ben Steane's right-wing cross from 8 yards out. Hines then made a one-handed reflex save to deny makeshift centre-forward Andy Spencer who latched onto Asa Charlton's deep cross in the 36th minute and Ashby headed the resulting corner by the returning Dominic Reece over the bar.</p>
  <p>Yet, as in the previous week, Halesowen could not hold onto their lead until the interval and in the 44th minute Kevin WILSON equalised from the penalty spot after Stuart Skidmore handled a cross from the right in the penalty area.</p>
  <p>But the setback spurred Halesowen onto making a lively start to the second-half with Spencer turning to thump a 20-yard drive against the Bath post with Hines beaten in the 50th minute. Charlton then drove a long free-kick into the area in the 56th minute and Ashby's flick brought a fine save from Hines. With the ball breaking free and Team Bath unable to clear, ASHBY then hit the Bath post but picked up the rebound and side-stepped his marker to plant home his 22nd goal of the season from close range.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz almost increased their lead a minute later but Hines kept out a header from the hard-working Hollis and on 75 minutes good work from Lewis Baker put Spencer clear but he fired wide of the advancing Hines. Halesowen then had their own escape when Paul Tisdale cracked a 77th minute free-kick from the edge of the area against the underside of the cross-bar with Lowe beaten.</p>
  <p>Halesowen could have wrapped up the game again in the 89th minute but Spencer's shot was blocked and Baker blazed over the bar after Ashby beat the Team Bath goalkeeper and then Hollis lobbed high when a better option was to roll the ball across goal to Ashby.</p>
  <p>A series of second-half injuries lead to 8 minutes of stoppage time and in the 97th minute Halesowen needlessly conceded two more free-kicks on the edge of their area but the defence cleared to register an important three points.</p>

    <h3>FAT  Yeltz 1 Hayes 3</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz once again failed to make much progress in the FA Trophy, losing 3-1 to Ryman Premier contenders .
    
  </p>
  <p>Saturday takes us back to the delightful Team Bath - which promises to be a fantastic day out.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Skidmore, Charlton, Grocutt, Jones, Baker, Hollis, Ashby (Hallam 68), Mitchell, Steane (Small 68), Spencer. Unused Subs: Colwell, Smith, Sheils</p>
  <p>Hayes: Cole; Cleary, Molesley, Bixby, Yeboah, Paul Holsgrove, L. Holsgrove, Williams, D. Warner, Scott (Peter Holsgrove 76), K. Warner. Unused Subs: Case, Cooper, Goodall</p>

  <p>Halesowen made a fine start but wilted to their first home defeat of the season after being reduced to ten men against their Ryman League visitors.</p>
  <p>In the first ever meeting between the teams, Halesowen goalkeeper Matt Lowe kept out Joshua Scott's deflected 3rd minute shot but it was Halesowen who made a golden start by taking a 6th minute lead. Ben Steane played a delightful pass from midfield to Simon HOLLIS on the right and he finished well from 12 yards out. Leon Mitchell then broke free of his marker in the 9th minute but headed weakly at goalkeeper Jake Cole.</p>
  <p>Lowe produced an impressive sequence of saves to preserve Halesowen's lead and turned Mark Molesley's 11th minute shot away for a corner. Hollis volleyed wide for the home side on 18 minutes after Lewis Baker won the ball in midfield before Lowe made another fine reflex save with his foot to deny David Warner from a couple of yards out in the 19th minute. Lowe then tipped Kevin Warner's 22-yard free-kick around the post on the half-hour.</p>
  <p>Halesowen hopes of pulling off a cup shock were dashed in a nine-minute spell before half-time. Joshua SCOTT equalised for Hayes from the penalty spot after the ball struck the hand of Asa Charlton in the six-yard box in the 36th minute. Halesowen then lost their discipline in a series of skirmishes and Stuart Skidmore was shown the red card in the 44th minute for his second bookable offence after being booked only two minutes earlier in his 100th game for the Yeltz. Molesley's 20-yard freekick struck the Halesowen post seconds before the interval as Hayes gained the upper hand.</p>
  <p>The visitors proved too strong for ten-man Halesowen in the second half and strolled to victory with two further goals. LEE HOLSGROVE gave Hayes the lead three minutes after the break by firing into the corner of Lowe's net from 20-yards. With the Yeltz dropping back, Dwayne Williams hit just past the post after 57 minutes. The home defence were then far too slow to react to Kevin Warner's quickly taken free-kick on the hour allowing DAVID WARNER to touch home in an unmarked position from close range.</p>
  <p>Halesowen found it difficult to create chances in a matter-of-fact second half although Cole palmed away from Mitchell in the 62nd minute. In the dying minutes Lowe blocked well from David Warner and then saved from Molesley.</p>

    <h3>BSC  Yeltz 2 Banbury 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz just about struggled through to the next round of the Birmingham Senior Cup, with a last minute penalty winner from Jason clinching the victory in what sounds like a poor game. More in .

<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Sheils; Jones (Colwell 70), Small, Smith, Charlton, Skidmore, Hollis, Hallam, Mitchell (Ashby HT), Steane (Baker HT), Spencer. Unused Subs: Grocutt, Lowe</p>

  <p>Halesowen struggled into the next round with a last minute winner from the penalty spot against Dr Martens Eastern Division Banbury.</p>
  <p>In a dull first-half, Jason Allen's 4th minute header was saved on the line by home goalkeeper Mark Sheils and George Redknap's 11th minute cross from the right was turned behind by Andy Spencer for the first of two Banbury corners.</p>
  <p>The Puritans took a 12th minute lead in sloppy fashion when Sheils failed to clear a right-wing corner and Wayne BLOSSOM headed home from 5 yards against a static defence.</p>
  <p>Andy Spencer toe-poked wide on 18 minutes and after Halesowen's first corner on 23 minutes Mark Hallam started and ended a 23rd minute move but headed Bryan Small's cross just wide. The Yeltz ended a poor half with Spencer's 37th minute snapshot turned for a corner and goalkeeper Simon Tricker collected another Spencer drive three minutes before the break.</p>
  <p>Manager Brendan Phillips rang the half-time changes but it was Chris Potter who struck just wide for the visitors on 52 minutes. Hallam set up Lewis Baker on the hour but Tricker easily saved before the Yeltz finally clicked into gear. On 62 minutes Banbury's defence cleared a Simon Hollis free-kick after Tricker lost the ball under pressure from captain-for-the-evening Asa Charlton and a Dan Jones thunderbolt was blocked for a corner three minutes later. Hollis then hit a 25-yard free-kick just over the bar.</p>
  <p>Banbury should have sealed the game on 71 minutes when Mark Simm's header fell to George Redknap but he crashed the ball against the underside of the bar and the hosts escaped to equalise a minute later with HALLAM heading home Charlton's free-kick from close range.</p>
  <p>Jason Ashby and Hallam both raced into the box in the 76th minute but just failed to meet a Hollis cross and a minute later Spencer fired just wide. Hallam then headed a Richard Colwell cross just wide and Sheils saved a Scott Taylor shot low down in the 82nd minute at the other end.</p>
  <p>With extra-time looming, Hallam was bundled over in the box in the 89th minute and ASHBY hit home his 20th goal of the campaign from the penalty spot.</p>

  <p>Last season's relegated teams battled out a goal-less draw in an evenly matched contest although Ben Steane missed a golden chance to seal a Yeltz victory with just three minutes remaining.</p>
  <p>Home goalkeeper Darren Horrigan raced off his line in the 5th minute to deny Simon Hollis from Jason Ashby's cross and in the 9th minute Ilkeston's Aaron O'Connor drove wide from 20-yards. Hollis's 10th minute cross was then turned away for a corner with the home defence under pressure from Leon Mitchell after Ashby chased a long ball. The home side won two corners in the 32nd minute and O'Connor hit over a dangerous cross in the 42nd minute but Halesowen just edged the first-half with two further telling crosses from Hollis flashing across the Ilkeston goal-mouth.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz weathered a spell of Ilkeston pressure at the start of the second period and in the 51st minute Richard Colwell made an important goal-line clearance to keep the scores level. A minute later substitute Phil Stant flashed a header across goal from a John Burns corner. For the visitors Hollis hit wide from 20-yards on 53 minutes and Halesowen then forced four consecutive corners in the 63rd minute but could not find the killer touch.</p>
  <p>Chris Freestone headed a 67th minute cross just wide and Michael Lyons curled just wide from 20-yards ten minutes later for Ilkeston. Lyons then hit a right-wing cross inches over Mark Sheil's bar in the 85th minute with Ilkeston searching desperately for their first win in their last ten outings.</p>
  <p>Steane volleyed a Hollis cross over the bar with five minutes left before his glaring miss in front of the Ilkeston goal in the 87th minute when he hit tamely at Horrigan after being set-up by Ashby with an empty net and three valuable points at his mercy.</p>

  <p>They weren't very good at all - not surprisingly seeing as they haven't a single win this season - &#xD;

    <p>
  <p>Aftre last year's run to the Final, the mighty Yeltz lost 2-1 in their League Cup First Round tie at Bromsgrove. We took the lead through Leon in the first half, but they equalised soon after and then got the winner in the second half. One more distraction out of the way ;-)</p>

  <p>Last season's runners-up Halesowen fell at the first hurdle despite taking an early lead.</p>
  <p>Simon Hollis's 12th minute right-wing corner just evaded Richard Kavanagh before debutant Halesowen goalkeeper Mark Sheils did well to turn Kevin Banner's 20-yard free-kick around the post for a corner. Kavanagh then connected with a 16th minute Hollis cross but Steve Frost cleared off the line.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz went ahead on 21 minutes when Hollis broke from midfield and laid the ball off for Leon MITCHELL to fire home under goalkeeper Paul Wyatt from 10-yards.</p>
  <p>Bromsgrove levelled four minutes later with Paul SZEWCZYK volleying home a looping deflection from six yards against a static defence. Mark Hallam's 27th minute volley was saved by Wyatt but Bromsgrove then missed a 34th minute penalty with Steve Pope crashing against the bar and Andy Spencer clearing the rebound off the line after Michael Swan was brought down.</p>
  <p>The home side notched a 51st minute winner when SZEWCZYK was allowed to turn in the six-yard box from Chris Dawson's cross. Halesowen's Hallam drove wide on 77 minutes and Wyatt collected Hollis's 20-yard shot at the second attempt on 83 minutes. In the dying moments, Hollis cut in from the right but hit past the post and Kavanagh struck over the bar. At the other end Bromsgrove#s Banner was left free in injury time but also hit high over the bar.</p>

  <p>Jason Ashby and Leon Mitchell both completed late hat-tricks at the goals-galore &#xD;
Grove in a game Halesowen controlled but almost threw away.</p>
  <p>Halesowen poured forward from the start and the writing was on the wall for &#xD;
Bedworth in the 3rd minute when James Richardson headed a dangerous &#xD;
cross from Richard Colwell behind his own goal for a corner. Lewis Baker headed &#xD;
just wide and Ben Steane shot weakly at former Yeltz goalkeeper Gary Hateley in &#xD;
the 5th minute. Andy Spencer was put clear by Simon Hollis in the &#xD;
15th minute but could only flick the ball into the arms of Hateley &#xD;
and a 19th minute header from Darren Grocutt fell onto the top of the &#xD;
Bedworth net.</p>
  <p>The opening Halesowen goal finally arrived in the 35th minute with &#xD;
MITCHELL heading home a Hollis cross after Ashby held up the ball near the &#xD;
goal-line. Two minutes later ASHBY increased the lead by turning home Spencer's &#xD;
cross off the inside of the post.</p>
  <p>With more goals looking imminent Hollis hit a spectacular 39th minute &#xD;
volley at Hateley from Mitchell's cross and Baker headed a Steane corner high. &#xD;
On the stroke of half-time Spencer's 20-yard shot drifted wide and Mitchell hit &#xD;
a great chance high over the bar and down the Stourbridge Road from just 8 yards &#xD;
out.</p>
  <p>The in-form Hateley produced a fine reflex save to deny Ashby from five yards &#xD;
immediately after the re-start as it seemed the floodgates were about to open. &#xD;
But Bedworth pulled a goal back two minutes after the break when Kevin CHARLEY &#xD;
burst through the Halesowen defence to fire past Matt Lowe from 18 yards in &#xD;
their first real attempt on goal.</p>
  <p>ASHBY restored the two-goal advantage three minutes later from the penalty spot &#xD;
after Ben Steane was tugged back in the area. Mitchell then saw his stunning &#xD;
20-yard shot tipped over for a corner by the busy Hateley in the 54th &#xD;
minute.</p>
  <p>The plucky visitors mounted another unlikely comeback to equalise with two &#xD;
further goals in four minutes. Martin Crowley's 58th minute free-kick &#xD;
was turned away by Lowe and Kirk Smith hit the loose ball against the bar &#xD;
leaving CHARLEY to slot home into the empty net. The Yeltz defence was caught &#xD;
napping again when substitute Darren MASSINGHAM headed home through a crowd of &#xD;
players directly from a right wing corner in the 62nd minute.</p>
  <p>
    
      <P>Just when a draw seemed on the cards Halesowen's potent attack produced three &#xD;
late goals. Hateley rushed out of his area in the 84th minute but was &#xD;
beaten to the ball by the pacy MITCHELL who side-stepped the goalkeeper before &#xD;
curling a superb 20-yard shot into the unprotected net. MITCHELL completed a &#xD;
fine hat-trick in the 88th minute by latching onto a long ball from &#xD;
Hollis before crashing past Hateley. ASHBY completed the party to notch his own &#xD;
hat-trick and 19th goal of the season in the final minute when a deft &#xD;
back-heel from Steane put him clear to stroke home with the Bedworth defence in &#xD;
tatters.</P>

    <h3>FAT  Yeltz 3 Team Bath 2</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz are through to meet  in the FA Trophy, after coming back from two down to beat Team Bath 3-2. After the experience of the weekend, I think it's a game that everyone really wanted to win, as well as wanting a decent run in the Trophy. Full details in .
    
  </p>
  <p>On Saturday, Bedworth are the visitors to The Grove in a league game that we'll be looking for maximum points from.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Small (Kavanagh 78), Charlton, Grocutt, Jones, Baker, Hollis (Skidmore 61), Ashby, Hallam (Mitchell 61), Steane, Spencer. Unused Subs: Smith, Sheils</p>
  <p>Team Bath: Gibson; Otto, Watson, Nichols, Holland, Metitiri, Gillingham, Canham (Lock HT), Stocco, Blake (Lewis 61), Prince (Reeves 86). Unused Subs: Tisdale, Parkin</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Hamilton (Cheltenham) Attendance: 245</p>
  <p>Halesowen fought back to progress into the next round against Hayes after falling two goals behind at half-time in a pulsating replay.</p>
  <p>The home side made a smart start and charged towards the Bath goal in the opening minutes. Ben Steane's 2nd minute lob was caught by Chris Gibson to earn an early corner. Mark Hallam swept the ball just over the bar in the 13th minute after Andy Spencer robbed Ali Otto on the left and Hallam's header struck the post on 20 minutes with goalkeeper Chris Gibson beaten from a deep Simon Hollis cross. Jason Ashby and Bryan Small fired high with Gibson in all sorts of trouble when he sliced the ball on 22 minutes and a Hollis screamer fell just wide a minute later. Steane then made a fine run from midfield only to see his 24th minute lob hit the crossbar.</p>
  <p>But Bath took the lead against all the odds on 26 minutes with their first attempt when goalkeeper Matt Lowe punched away a Mike Gillingham cross under pressure from Tom Stocco and the ball fell for David BLAKE to side-step his marker and hit home from 15-yards. Marc Canham caned the Halesowen crossbar three minutes later before Team Bath added a clinical second goal in the 32nd minute when Blake crossed from the right for the unmarked CANHAM to rifle home from 18 yards. Halesowen forced three consecutive corners in the 40th minute but Ashby fired wide from 6 yards with Gibson flapping at the ball.</p>
  <p>The Yeltz gave themselves a 50th minute lifeline when Hallam headed on a Hollis cross for Andy SPENCER to volley home his first goal of the season from close range. The game then went into a quiet spell until Luke Prince broke from midfield in the 66th minute but was denied by Lowe turning a goal-bound shot away for a corner. A minute later the visitors failed to make the game safe when centre-half Dan Jones gave away the ball to substitute Chris Lewis but Lowe produced another superb blocking save.</p>
  <p>Ashby lobbed over the bar for the Yeltz on 73 minutes before substitute Leon MITCHELL turned to fire home Halesowen's equaliser in the 79th minute from 10 yards after latching onto Darren Grocutt's cross. In a strong finish, Mitchell then played a sweet ball through to Ashby but the leading marksman hit weakly at Gibson.</p>
  <p>STEANE crowned a fine game to seal victory in the 85th minute with a cool 15-yard finish to notching his first goal for the club after Mitchell just failed to beat Gibson from close range. On 90 minutes Stocco lobbed just wide for the visitors and in injury time Halesowen's Spencer crossed for the unmarked Mitchell but he failed to beat Gibson.</p>

    <h3>FAT  Team Bath 0 Yeltz 0</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz remain in the FA Trophy after a 0-0 draw against the "students" of Team Bath. Unfortunately I wasn't at the game, but from what  on the Bath City forum it doesn't sound as though it was the best away trip we've ever had. I'd be very interested in the views of anyone else who was there, and particularly if anyone from  would like to give us the benefit of their educated views.  is waiting.
    
  </p>
  <p>The replay is on Tuesday, so let's hope we can get through and start on a decent run in the Trophy for once. It's the first of a run of three home games, including the visit of Bedworth next Saturday.</p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Team Bath: Gibson; Otto, Wisson, Lock, Holland, Tilson, Gillingham (Nicholls 84), Canham (Tisdale 65), Stocco (Dembicki 72), Lewis, Prince. Unused Subs: Watson, Parkin.</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Colwell, Charlton, Grocutt, Jones, Baker, Hollis (Steane 58), Ashby, Hallam (Mitchell 69), Spencer, Kavanagh (Small 58). Unused Subs: Skidmore, Sheils</p>
  <p>Referee: I. Hamilton (Cheltenham) Attendance: 140 Booked: Charlton (77)</p>
  <p>Halesowen forced a Tuesday replay with their third consecutive clean sheet in a dreary contest that provided little entertainment to enthuse the sparse crowd.</p>
  <p>But the major talking point amongst Halesowen followers was how the lavishly public-funded Team Bath project denied them even the most basic of facilities that are now customary at far lower levels of football. The situation is likely to be taken up by the Halesowen Town Supporters Association making its opinion known by letters of complaint to the relevant parties.</p>
  <p>On the pitch, the almost artificial University of Bath campus setting with the pitch surrounded by an athletics track produced an instantly forgettable game. Andy Spencer won Halesowen's first corner in the 5th minute but Richard Kavanagh's kick was easily cleared. Dan Jones then tidied up in the Yeltz defence on 8 minutes when Chris Lewis beat the offside trap. Bath's first corner on 10 minutes from Luke Prince came to nothing before Tom Stocco again beat the offside trap but fired wide from 15 yards out. Goalkeeper Matt Lowe then collected a 20-yard Mike Gillingham shot and caught Andy Tilson's effort from a Prince free-kick in the 14th minute.</p>
  <p>Home goalkeeper Chris Gibson raced off his line to clear from leading marksman Jason Ashby on 19 minutes and then produced a fingertip stop to turn away Andy Spencer's 15-yard drive after 27 minutes. Opposite number Lowe then did well to take Gillingham's 36th minute corner under pressure in a crowded goal area.</p>
  <p>The second-half misery continued with neither side looking likely to break the stalemate although Lowe saved low down on 53 minutes when Gillingham cut in from the right. Simon Hollis then forced a 57th minute save from Gibson and Lowe had to alert at the other end in the 70th minute to keep out an attempted lob from Prince. Ali Otto then shot over the bar from 10-yards in the 73rd minute and Lewis headed a 73rd minute corner from Paul Tisdale over the bar. In the dying seconds, Halesowen substitute Leon Mitchell saw his 20-yard shot easily saved by Gibson.</p>

    <h3>Solihull 0 Yeltz 1</h3>

    <p>
  <p>
    The mighty Yeltz continued their rise up the table with an excellent 1-0 victory over Solihull Borough. A second-half goal from the league's top scorer  brought us an important three points and moved us up to  and still with games in hand over most of the teams above us. More details in DJ's match report.
    
  </p>
</p>
<h3>Match Report from DJ</h3>

  <p>Solihull Borough: Gayle; Hamilton, Hier (Hawker 72), Preston, Barry, A. Cooper, Campbell, I. Cooper, Hunter, Arshad (Amos 66), Lutz (Hewitt 78). Unused Sub: Dodd</p>
  <p>Halesowen Town: Lowe; Colwell, Charlton, Grocutt, Jones, Baker, Hollis, Ashby, Holmes, Spencer, Kavanagh. Unused Subs: Hallam, Steane, Smith, Mitchell, Small</p>
  <p>Referee: R. J. Steans (Loughborough) Attendance: 326 Booked: I. Cooper (15)</p>
  <p>Jason Ashby secured three points by notching his 16th goal of the season with a stunning second half strike after missing an earlier penalty.</p>
  <p>Halesowen goalkeeper Matt Lowe was barely troubled all afternoon as the Yeltz took charge and they should have won by a greater margin as Solihull failed to live up to expectations.</p>
  <p>In a quiet opening, David Holmes lobbed over the Solihull bar in the 7th minute and then turned to win Halesowen's first corner after 13 minutes. Darren Grocutt headed a Simon Hollis free-kick tamely at goalkeeper Mark Gayle on 20 minutes and with the visitors comfortably on-top Andy Spencer cut in from the right for Gayle to save low down two minutes later. Spencer then flicked a 25th minute header just wide from Richard Kavanagh's 25th minute cross.</p>
  <p>Dan Jones gifted Solihull their best and only meaningful chance of the game when he failed to notice Adam Cooper behind him and left a 27th minute cross but Lowe raced off his line with the ball being cleared in the resulting goal-mouth scramble.</p>
  <p>Pete Barry brought down ex-Solihull midfielder Hollis from behind in the 33rd minute to give Halesowen a penalty but ex-Halesowen goalkeeper Gayle used his knowledge from his former club to read Ashby's usual routine and dived to his left to push away the spot-kick.</p>
  <p>The visitors continued to dominate the second half with Kavanagh volleying a 57th minute Hollis cross over the bar. Paul Hunter put Jamie Campbell through on the hour for the home side but Lowe was on hand to save.</p>
  <p>Halesowen sealed the game in the 64th minute with a goal of pure class from ASHBY who picked up a pass from Jones and turned a full circle before curling into the top corner from 15 yards for a worthy "goal of the season" candidate</p>
  <p>Hollis then brought a flying save out of Gayle with a fierce half-volley from the right after 73 minutes. At the other end, Halesowen were never seriously threatened further although Adam Cooper glanced a free-header straight at Lowe in the dying seconds.</p>
